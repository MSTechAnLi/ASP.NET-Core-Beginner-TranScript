1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:07,123
Hey friends, we're glad you're still with us here at Microsoft Virtual Academy as we do our intro to ASP.NET Core.

2
00:00:07,123 --> 00:00:08,595
We're learning all about razor pages and our application.

3
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,371
-This module will be a little longer -Yes it will

4
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:16,975
And it will probably have us making some mistakes together,and that's okay.

5
00:00:17,257 --> 00:00:19,219
And we're gonna try not to hide anything from you.

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:24,339
We are following the documentation as we hope that are, and maybe you can follow along.

7
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:27,987
Pause, try stuff out, and maybe Google with Bing.

8
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:28,883
Google with Bing.

9
00:00:28,883 --> 00:00:30,547
If you have trouble and get stuck.

10
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:34,323
Yeah, and we will have links to the documentation right underneath this recording.

11
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:39,281
All right, so we're gonna try to make a CRUD page.

12
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:39,971
What is CRUD?

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,777
Create,read, update, delete.

14
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:54,675
All right, so a CRUD application maps verbs from CRUD to verbs that we're used to using,like get is a get, so it would be like a read.

15
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:57,358
And if you're gonna create something, it would be a post.

16
00:00:57,358 --> 00:01:06,126
So you'd fill out a form, you'd hit submit, and it would post the data, that's a create Then you can maybe read it back and look at in edit page or then maybe delete it.

17
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:12,718
So if we succeed, we'll have the simple form,maybe create some customers, put them in a fake database And we'll be okay

18
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:16,625
Yeah, and I will be learning more about databases in the intermediate course as well 

19
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,606
Yes,well like a whole section on databases.

20
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:20,846
So for now, we're gonna be doing it in an in-memory database.

21
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:23,598
Okay, so let's do the best we can.

22
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:26,862
We're gonna use the same web application one that we created before.

23
00:01:26,862 --> 00:01:39,225
We saw in the previous modules where we added MVC, but of course all of that stuff was added for us because we went File > New Project,and we picked Web Application, all right?

24
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:44,782
So here in configure services, we've got AddMvc.

25
00:01:44,782 --> 00:01:48,430
But we're gonna make our little in-memory database here.

26
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:53,358
We're gonna say services.AddDbContext<>

27
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:55,150
Yeah, and give it name

28
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,030
And we gonna create a thing called AppDbContext.

29
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,630
We can name it whatever we want to.

30
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,638
We haven't written this yet, but we will.

31
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:05,902
I'm gonna hit Ctrl+dot.

32
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:10,382
And it's saying, hey, do you need an AppDbContext?

33
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:12,878
Do you wanna go and generate one of those?

34
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:14,670
I wanna go ahead and say yes.

35
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,190
So it's gone and done that, and we'll deal with that in a minute.

36
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,414
And again, I will very likely make mistakes, so you'll bear with me I hope.

37
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:27,214
I opened up the parentheses there.

38
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,942
And I'm gonna pass in some options.

39
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:35,470
- And the option I'm gonna pass in for my database context are options -UseInmemory.

40
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,966
-Use -In.

41
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,270
MemoryDatabase.

42
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:43,406
Yes, but the reason why that's not showing,that perfect.

43
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:44,942
-We need to add -why is that not showing up?

44
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:47,806
So we need to add the entity framework.

45
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:49,150
So we need to use

46
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,006
And I probably should have added that first, and

47
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:52,158
I would have gotten IntelliSense.

48
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:53,758
-True -Let's try that.

49
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:56,254
If we go back up to the top.

50
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,590
So we add the EntityFrameworkCore beforehand.

51
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,614
Look, you see that little arrow there that's pointing down?

52
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:19,166
That means that this method came in was included by the fact that we just did that UseIn.

53
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,425
That's called an extension method,it's along for the ride.

54
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,334
And you see it actually says extension,that wasn't there seconds ago

55
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:27,614
No, it wasn't.

56
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:37,406
Add InMemoryDatabase, some name All right,And then we look at the squiggle and we worry.

57
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:39,582
Does the squiggle mean something?

58
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,550
So, here it's saying AddDbContext.

59
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,598
Well, we never really went and did anything with that AddDbContext.

60
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,158
Let's go over there and fix that,I'm gonna right click and say go to definition.

61
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,294
And let's work on our database context.

62
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:55,134
This is kind of standard stuff, so don't worry about it too much.

63
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,206
But basically this is representing the database.

64
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:01,278
I'm hitting Ctrl+dot there.

65
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:07,900
And I'll say make it an AppDbContext,this is an constructor, all right?

66
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:14,078
Okay, and we're gonna take in some options.

67
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,375
-ContextOptions,Oops, optoons -Options?

68
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:27,011
Options, pass up to the base class those options.

69
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:28,419
I'm gonna put that.

70
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:33,150
What I'm trying to zoom and make it helpful for you, I end up making it worse for myself.

71
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:36,675
Well, at least you have other people in mind.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,278
-I do. And then -You have to set it of some sort.

73
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:45,054
We have a set of, we're gonna say customers?

74
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,684
So we have a set of customer.

75
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:47,900
Customer does not exist here.

76
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,576
That's why it's squiggled out.

77
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:54,393
And then we do a getter, setter, get ; set, okay?

78
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:56,248
Customer is squiggled out.

79
00:04:56,248 --> 00:04:59,192
The type or namespace 'Customer' could not be found.

80
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:01,560
Well, that's true cuz we haven't made one yet.

81
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:02,648
We had not made it up.

82
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:06,424
l could type control dot, but l am gonna click show potential fixes.

83
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,664
This is kind of interesting.

84
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:11,224
Here it's saying, well, I can go and make customer for you.

85
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:12,696
But look at this here.

86
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:18,392
It's suggesting other packages that have the word customer and the name customer in it.

87
00:05:18,392 --> 00:05:21,784
So these are other NuGet packages,packages up in the world.

88
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:22,744
Yeah, ain't that cool?

89
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:23,448
That's very cool.

90
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,275
-Package out there that has the word customer in it -Has the word customer in it

91
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,102
No, I don't want those.

92
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:37,464
But if I was doing something with JSON or doing something with some technology that I knew I will need the NuGet packages, later it will go get it for me.

93
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:40,792
So I'm gonna say generate in new file, that seems reasonable.

94
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:43,800
-It does -All right, this generated that.

95
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,528
Now notice it just appeared.

96
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:52,225
-There it is -And now I'm gonna right click and say go to definition

97
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:56,975
It is worth pointing out that I could also right click and say Peak Definition.

98
00:05:56,975 --> 00:06:00,130
-And could you write in there? -I could.

99
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,225
I think that would be a little weird.

100
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:10,300
But then I can click on this little tab right here Promote to Document, and now I've jumped into that document.

101
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:16,175
So I can peek and then if I type a little bit,I was like this is tiresome, then I could jump even higher.

102
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,757
-That's pretty smooth. -It is pretty smooth.

103
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:21,405
-All right, I'll show you another smooth tip. -I know it.

104
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:24,413
-Yeah? You wanna suggest? -The tab tab thing?

105
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:27,741
-Yes, ready? -Prop Tab.

106
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:36,325
-Tab, tab -int Tab Id Enter Enter prop Tab Tab string Enter Tab Name.

107
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:40,480
-How cool is that? -It's cool, and I always forget to use it.

108
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,296
-You gotta use it. -I always forget to use it and it's awesome.

109
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:46,880
-There's so much good stuff in there. -There's also propfull.

110
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,080
-What does that do? -That gives you a backing variable.

111
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,350
There's propa,which I don't know what it does but it's crazy.

112
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:02,400
There's propg for a getter with a private setter.

113
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,488
Yeah, a bunch of stuff.

114
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:07,624
-Have you done a blog post on all the properties 

115
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:10,312
There's a bunch of snippets,I could go all day.

116
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:12,680
But I'm just gonna use prop for now.

117
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,584
So this is customer, so customers have an ID,a unique ID.

118
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:18,184
And they have a name.

119
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:20,552
And they could probably have an email,they could have all these things.

120
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,392
We'll start with name for now, but should name have some constraints?

121
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:28,040
It should,we have an idea of data annotation.

122
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,088
There's annotation on that data, yes.

123
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:33,096
So one of the things is that you probably want someone to enter their name, right?

124
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:38,408
-We wanna force them. -We wanna force them, so we want to make sure it some sort of required, right?

125
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:43,656
So required, and I'm putting that as a notation here and I'm gonna hit Ctrl+dot, again.

126
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:50,696
When you learn that these things exist and you're thinking about them rather than typing in all this stuff for the using,you're just gonna type required.

127
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:54,600
Hit Ctrl+dot, and then hit Enter.

128
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:00,296
Line 1 just appeared there And then we'll force the length as well.

129
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:05,032
We'll be silly for a moment, we'll say a length of 10.

130
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:06,824
That's not a very good length.

131
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:08,104
That is not a good length at all.

132
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,024
But that might allow us to do some validation later.

133
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:12,072
And then we'll change it to a longer length.

134
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:15,592
All right, so let's back up for a second and see what we did here.

135
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:20,520
So we have in our start up an InMemoryDatabase.

136
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,824
Not a SQLserver or a.

137
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:25,256
Whatever just in memory database.

138
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:37,401
We have a beginnings of a customer, unique ID and a name Some annotations on it, and then a little class here that's kind of empty.

139
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:43,850
That is our a list of customers and actually what's customer Singular here.

140
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,578
-Yeah. -That should be customers.

141
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:49,375
-Okay, because, you have a set. -This is a set of customers.

142
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:54,474
So the one thing, how are we going to see this information?

143
00:08:54,474 --> 00:09:01,514
Well, we're going to need to probably put some in the database and then,once we have them in the database, list them out.

144
00:09:01,514 --> 00:09:02,922
Like how are we going to visually see it?

145
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:05,610
Yeah, so there's a bit of a chicken and the egg problem there.

146
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,898
Do we make the listing page first and list them out?

147
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:12,202
But we really can't cuz we don't have any.

148
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:13,802
-You don't anything, yeah. -Or we make a create page first.

149
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:17,194
-So it's CRUD. -We'll do the C first, okay?

150
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:20,266
-So over in -The pages folder.

151
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:23,274
Pages, let's do create.

152
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:26,282
Now, we're not going to say new file like we did before.

153
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:29,546
No, you're going to create a new Razor Page or if you go to New File.

154
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:30,954
Let me do that again.

155
00:09:30,954 --> 00:09:34,026
Right click and I have two choices I have new.

156
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:35,818
-And then. -Page or I can say item.

157
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:36,650
Yeah, New Item.

158
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,594
And they should be the option to pick Razor Page.

159
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:43,306
Right, so you got a couple different options here and this is all the different things that you could make.

160
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:56,685
I'm gonna go and right click and say add Razor page, and I wanna point out that I'm not gonna do it for this because it will be a little bit cheating but after we're all done, first, we make you suffer.

161
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:59,053
And then we show you the easy way And then we show you the easy way

162
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:07,462
We could create that model and say Razor page is using entity framework CRUD, and then it will then scaffold or generate.

163
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:10,342
-Every single -All the hard parts that we're about to do.

164
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:14,825
But it's more fun to do, no no,it's more fun to do it ourselves, don't you think?

165
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:17,958
-All right. -All right, lets do it ourselves.

166
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,006
People can fast forward if they don't like it.

167
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,294
The page name would be create.

168
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:26,854
Uh-huh, and then we're gonna use a layout, we saw that.

169
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:31,014
And then, here it says Generate PageModel,that's that code behind of that page model.

170
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:34,075
We could say no and then do that in line, if we wanted to.

171
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,886
All right. So let's see if that works.

172
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,425
Thinking, thinking, thinking.

173
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,966
We're gonna watch in the right hand side here as create should appear.

174
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:45,590
And sticking well because it's doing quite a bit of scaffolding.

175
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:50,902
Well, it's scaffolding up some workforce but it's also gonna build the application to see if it still builds.

176
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,422
And if it's running a scarf-folder.

177
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:57,650
And scar folder is something that you can go on a nd read about and write your own if you feel like it.

178
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,875
So here we gotta create.

179
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:03,574
-So let's see what we have in there -Let's see it gives us a page

180
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:17,525
It gave us a default model, a title, looks like a header, and then some validation scripts, and then presumably we can just start typing our pages or whatever.

181
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:23,478
Let's look at the backend,It made a create model that has a get.

182
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:26,422
So this is the function that happens when we get stuff.

183
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:27,254
Okay.

184
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,198
All right, so we're gonna need to make form code.

185
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:36,650
All right, so form that would have actually just one entry?

186
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,974
Yeah, so we'll say enter your name, figure, all right.

187
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:44,079
And who knows if this will work, again, we're gonna learn.

188
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,431
Now, this is interesting, noticed that when I typed form Why is it in purple?

189
00:11:48,431 --> 00:12:02,433
Turns purple, so that is a tag helper, this is some related elements that are gonna be on the server for processing so the server knows about purple elements, and ill do some processing of them.

190
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:12,545
Typically when you're in HTML, you have like a P tag or an image tag or div, and that's just strings that get sent off to the client.

191
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:22,785
But when we're generating this stuff on the server side,there might be an opportunity for ASP.NET Core to improve it,to change it, to add stuff.

192
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:24,385
So it knows about form.

193
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:27,969
Form is a magic tag and we can go and type things like this,you see it says asp colon.

194
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:33,281
Yeah, so is that indication that that is a tag helper or some sort of action?

195
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:36,025
Right these things aren't html.

196
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:37,569
-No -Those are tag helpers

197
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:43,265
You'll never see asp hyphen something being sent all the way out to the browser.

198
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:45,953
These are not HTML,They're hints to the server.

199
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:52,225
So if when we run this application, and we go into the F12 tools, we will not see- You shouldn't see those.

200
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:53,300
-Okay -Exactly

201
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,750
-So we're gonna say form, this is gonna be basic method= a,yep see Get, post, put, delete

202
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,422
We'll say post So we're gonna go and post.

203
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,761
Here's the end of our form.

204
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,025
Say div, name, and then we'll need a text box.

205
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:09,313
Yep so some sort of input tag.

206
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:11,617
Yep input,Now, this is interesting.

207
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,441
We could do an input tag the way we usually do or we could say ASP.NET4.

208
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:22,817
-Okay -And we're gonna say Customer.Name.

209
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:25,313
-Okay -See how it's all purple?

210
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,825
That ASP 4 is gonna look at that model, okay?

211
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:34,950
Now, it's saying here, I don't know what a Customer is.

212
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,441
What's going on with that?

213
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,465
It's never heard of Customer before.

214
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,923
We'll come back and fix that in a second.

215
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:45,225
Then we'll have an input for submitting that form, okay?

216
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:48,735
But we have a problem here,where it doesn't know what Customer is.

217
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,625
What is the model for this page?

218
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,687
-Right, it's the -The Create

219
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:57,275
CreateModel, so let's go look at that.

220
00:13:58,225 --> 00:13:59,871
Peek into Definition, okay.

221
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:01,343
I wanna point out how I'm moving around.

222
00:14:01,343 --> 00:14:05,300
I'm right clicking and saying Go To Definition is also a hotkey for that.

223
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:11,839
So this is an important reminder, just as a programmer,you don't wanna necessarily find yourself going over and looking around all the files all the time.

224
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,719
-You can navigate -To it, right?

225
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:17,750
To it directly, you can navigate logically, as they say.

226
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,183
-Okay, all right. -Did you?

227
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,871
-Cut something out from -Yeah

228
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:25,855
-Okay -Great.

229
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:28,275
-There we go -I cut out CreateModel, thank you.

230
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:36,725
Right so, our create model is gonna need to know about customers, because that's gonna show up on the page.

231
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:39,675
So public Customer, that's a type.

232
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:42,990
-That's a name -You can tell by the color.

233
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,334
It's a little confusing.

234
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:49,390
But, the property is called Customer, and the type is called Customer.

235
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:59,822
And, this is going to need that database context,so we are going to make a little Database here.

236
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:03,982
And this is just being the voice of the person doing this at home.

237
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:07,725
Why have you made it private read only?

238
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:09,934
So that's a great point.

239
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:16,782
I don't want people who get a hold of create model to be poking around and talking directly to the database.

240
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:21,774
So, it's gonna be private, just for me where me is CreateModel.

241
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:27,790
And it's read only which means I'm gonna assign it once, and I don't want anyone to touch it after that.

242
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,590
-Yeah. Okay -So I'm making it just for me and making sure I can't mess with it afterwards.

243
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,894
Excellent, excellent question.

244
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:41,934
-So then, we'll make our -CreateModel Our constructor.

245
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:46,350
And remember how dependency injection works.

246
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,422
We don't make an AppDbContext we ask for one.

247
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:55,054
We ask for it by putting it in our constructor.

248
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:58,638
We can have as many of these as we want,We can have food and bar, etc, etc, etc.

249
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,366
This is the one we want for now.

250
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:06,391
And then I'm just going to say hey, this one equals this one.

251
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:09,655
I'm going to squirrel it away and hang onto it, so now I've got one.

252
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,425
So that says there's this database, and I want to know about it.

253
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,206
This says there's a customer.

254
00:16:20,206 --> 00:16:29,934
If I go back over to create, I can hover over that and see it's getting me probably IntelliSense too.

255
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:31,662
Yep, see. Now, it is.

256
00:16:31,662 --> 00:16:36,654
So, it knows about customer because it's hanging off of the model.

257
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,110
So as we're running the application.

258
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,486
Technically, I should be able to go to this page,hover over customer name and see what names we've put in there?

259
00:16:45,486 --> 00:16:48,942
You should be able to click on that,you should be able to have IntelliSense.

260
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:54,958
If you did a break point,you should be able to stop in here at some point and look at that, and we'll do that in a little bit.

261
00:16:55,675 --> 00:17:01,422
What we need, though, is we need to bind this form.

262
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:04,686
We're saying this input for customer name.

263
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:10,830
When I hit submit, we need to catch it on the server side.

264
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,070
I call it surviving the journey.

265
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,414
Okay. Yeah, it's a good point.

266
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:15,310
It does need to survive the journey.

267
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,038
So I'm gonna get rid of this OnGet here.

268
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:18,574
So we're gonna do a post.

269
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,902
You can say OnPost.

270
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:26,550
You could do it like this but the right way to do it is like this.

271
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:36,238
-Async? -Async, which means don't block, and we're gonna have a task that returns some action.

272
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:41,806
We might be doing something after this and I'm gonna say on OnPostAsync.

273
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,885
And it's giving me a little complaint here saying!

274
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:53,789
You didn't do a wait and you haven't returned a value.

275
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:59,805
Code paths, not all code paths return a value.

276
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:01,405
That's cuz we haven't done anything yet.

277
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:08,125
So, when someone posts back, they hit submit,and it posts back to here.

278
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:11,350
We would really like customer to have stuff in it.

279
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,845
-Yes -And so there's a couple things here.

280
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:18,975
And then we need to make sure that the state of that model is valid, that someone hasn't messed with it.

281
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:30,280
So I'm gonna say if ModelState.IsValid,or if it's not, pardon me- I was about to say something.

282
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:36,168
No I appreciate that,Then return the page back to itself to say now I'm done.

283
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:43,016
If I hover over page you can see it returns a page result,which is a kind of action.

284
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:44,600
Returning a page is an action.

285
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,696
If we get this far, now I'm gonna say db,remember when I say db?

286
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,040
-Yes -What is db?

287
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:58,440
It is a applicationDB context.

288
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,832
In there is customers, plural.

289
00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:04,072
-And we want to add one. -.Add()

290
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:08,040
We'll pass in the customer that we just got handed.

291
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,160
And then we'll say, hang out for a minute, await.

292
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,328
And we'll say, db.SaveChanges,And async means don't wait

293
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:26,152
Then we will go and return,not a page, because we're on the create page.

294
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:28,264
We really wanna return to the list.

295
00:19:28,264 --> 00:19:29,736
Yeah, so you're doing a redirect?

296
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,976
We're gonna do a redirect, exactly.

297
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:35,950
And we haven't got a place to go yet,But we'll say redirect to page

298
00:19:36,264 --> 00:19:41,675
Okay. And you can see that there's options like redirect to page permanent, which would be a 301.

299
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:43,437
-Okay -Http 301

300
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:48,875
We're gonna do a 302 because this is just a standard kind of redirect,Let's just say /Index

301
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:52,988
And I think we should probably just say /,but we'll see what happens.

302
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:56,999
If people wanted to learn more about 301s,302s, do you have any recommendations?

303
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:58,983
-The Internet. -Correct

304
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,479
I would search around for that kind of stuff.

305
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:03,143
Ultimately look at the docs.

306
00:20:03,143 --> 00:20:12,679
-Yeah -But redirect to page is a standard thing and again if you hover over it, it says right there Status302Found.

307
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:18,759
But if I said RedirectToPagePermanent.

308
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,975
We would change it?

309
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:25,927
Change it to a 301, which would tell the search engine,don't ever come back here and ask me about this again.

310
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:28,423
Don't ever talk to me again go here.

311
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:29,050
-All right -That's what that means

312
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:35,137
I'm paranoid so anyway,you never wanna do that when you're doing database work.

313
00:20:35,137 --> 00:20:37,249
You always wanna be temporary, okay?

314
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:41,729
Okay. All right, and if you really,really, really wanna upset your coworkers.

315
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:47,299
You could move your curly braces.

316
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah.

317
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:50,025
And do stuff like this.

318
00:20:50,627 --> 00:20:57,027
And if you really wanna be possibly buggy,you could even do stuff like this.

319
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,825
-Where that's all one line -Yeah?

320
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,411
But you might have other stuff that you wanna do.

321
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:08,850
Okay. Some people that really bothers them, some people it doesn't.

322
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:10,979
For me- Does it bother you?

323
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,731
I kinda like it on one line if it's not that big of a deal.

324
00:21:14,425 --> 00:21:20,003
You know what I mean,but as soon as you have an extra line then you're gonna go and undo it and take it apart.

325
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:24,227
It's stylistic,so it's not really a best practice for someone to know of right now.

326
00:21:24,675 --> 00:21:28,579
No, for right now, I just think it's nice to have everything fit on one line like that.

327
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,227
But using the curly mustaches.

328
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,325
Is curly braces,they look like a mustache if you turn your head.

329
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:38,933
That's a best practice.

330
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:43,059
It still gets us, that when people say curly braces, and I don't know what they're talking about

331
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:43,750
-What do you call them? -cuz I use brackets

332
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,902
You call them brackets?

333
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:47,278
So you have brackets, curly brackets, square brackets, so.

334
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:49,600
-Scandalous -Okay

335
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:52,206
-You're fancy -That is pretty intense.

336
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:56,814
-Yeah -Okay, now I'm going to put a break point here.

337
00:21:56,814 --> 00:21:59,650
-Okay. And we'll see if this works -All right.

338
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,422
It might very well not work.

339
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:05,650
-Fingers crossed and toes -No, it's probably not gonna work

340
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,634
Lower your expectations now.

341
00:22:09,593 --> 00:22:11,257
-All right -Okay.

342
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,457
This is in create, right?

343
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:15,800
-So I have to hit /create -Yep

344
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:23,875
Okay

345
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Did we bind it?

346
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,715
-Yeah see what's happening? -Nothing.

347
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:38,339
-No -And if we go and do a view source.

348
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,795
-And you go to? -Okay.

349
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:44,419
I just want to show the people the form first.

350
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,779
Some things showed up on the input that's kinda cool.

351
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,219
-That's kinda nice -That is

352
00:22:57,219 --> 00:22:58,755
We didn't type that, right, remember?

353
00:22:58,755 --> 00:23:03,363
So we're getting stuff on the input that we did not expect,which is cool.

354
00:23:03,427 --> 00:23:05,667
I bet there's some request verification.

355
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:08,611
Yeah, they put a request verification token to keep people from tampering with our stuff.

356
00:23:09,325 --> 00:23:12,625
There is your name=Customer.Name.

357
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:15,587
And it generated an id for us as well.

358
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:18,083
But you can see that nothing's happening.

359
00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:28,140
On Customer, actually I wanna put a break point a little higher up, and then I'll explain to you what's going on.

360
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:31,020
Let's see if we can even get to the post.

361
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:40,556
Okay, do a debug session again /create.

362
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:49,414
So I would've expected.

363
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,606
-To hit that break point -To hit that break point, so that's concerning.

364
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:13,072
But I know that I need to say BindProperty on the customer which is to tell it I want this customer object filled out with the form information, right?

365
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:15,376
-Yeah. -And right now I don't have that.

366
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,352
So let's take a look, and try this again.

367
00:24:22,352 --> 00:24:32,175
The customer is gonna get created and filled up with information bound to those form fields.

368
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,925
If that doesn't work then I've forgotten something and we will go and have a little debugging which will be fun as well.

369
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:51,728
They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.

370
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:54,352
So let's take a look.

371
00:24:54,352 --> 00:24:56,272
It's probably something obvious.

372
00:24:59,408 --> 00:25:03,625
So we've got a form, we've got our input, we've got our method.

373
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:06,704
I said post, does it matter if it's all caps?

374
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:09,328
That would be odd if it did.

375
00:25:14,384 --> 00:25:15,792
So it doesn't matter.

376
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:23,920
The tag helper exists already in view imports,the form is there.

377
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,272
The only thing l didn't add is the validation summary, okay?

378
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:44,719
-Okay -All right, so l am putting in a long name, Fancy Pants, and nothing's happening.

379
00:25:44,783 --> 00:25:57,625
-No -No, and am realizing that I've got my form with my input for customer name,but I put my validation summary outside the form.

380
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:02,553
-Okay -So I am gonna put it inside the form,cuz it's validating the form.

381
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:15,519
And then I'm gonna hit Refresh, Fancy Pants, see and it says the Field Name, must be a string with maximum length of 10.

382
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,383
I'm getting that validation for free, right?

383
00:26:20,383 --> 00:26:22,111
And where did that 10 come from?

384
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,871
We set it in, yep, right there.

385
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:29,279
We set it right there.

386
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,695
So maybe we'll change that to like 25, or something like that.

387
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:38,495
Some people have really long names like in my country who have names which are 50, so maybe 100?

388
00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:40,991
I'll make 49 and then that one 50 person,they're gonna suffer.

389
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,000
-Man -inclusion. But the point is it's driven by

390
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:46,623
- By them -By them, okay?

391
00:26:46,623 --> 00:26:52,959
And then one other thing- So it'd be the same if someone did entered something that wasn't an email, right?

392
00:26:52,959 --> 00:27:01,279
Yeah, it could be an email, it could be,you can put in validation information however you want,and you could even put in custom, regular expressions, or even write your own custom validators.

393
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,751
So they could be as sophisticated as you want.

394
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:09,215
-Okay -You could also, I believe, say, I want a span.

395
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:18,303
And say asp-validation-for, and you could go and do a field by field validation, okay.

396
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:26,303
So here I'm saying this is my summary of all the different things, this is a specific validation for Customer Name.

397
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:36,725
Okay, let's see what that looks like And that might look a little different so if I come over here, come back over here and hit Refresh,oops I actually don't hit Refresh.

398
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:38,700
I need to run my app again cuz I stopped it.

399
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:40,835
Okay.

400
00:27:43,907 --> 00:27:45,059
Run that again.

401
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:48,899
Go to Create.

402
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:52,611
I think we made it really long this time, right?

403
00:27:54,723 --> 00:27:59,651
And I tab away and it says it must be a string with a maximum length of 49.

404
00:28:00,227 --> 00:28:00,675
Okay.

405
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:07,011
But I like the main validation stuff so we'll leave that like that, okay?

406
00:28:07,971 --> 00:28:18,723
Now, let's go back to our break points and run our debugger this time, and see if we can see the customer get found.

407
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:19,491
Okay.

408
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:29,411
We had looked in the F12 developer tools before,we could see what's happening on the wire.

409
00:28:29,411 --> 00:28:33,315
This is a good way to kinda just see what's happening as you do your posts.

410
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:38,243
-So when you're looking, so you went to Developer Tools -Yeah. And the network?

411
00:28:38,243 --> 00:28:40,099
I went to dot dot dot Developer Tools and we're under Network.

412
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:48,900
Okay. I will go and probably and clear it out, and then we'll put in Maria, okay.

413
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,411
Yep, there we go, so if you hover over that.

414
00:28:53,475 --> 00:29:02,051
If we hover over Customer, see,because customer has a name.

415
00:29:02,051 --> 00:29:08,963
Yeah. Customer.name, and we name the field Customer.name, and we told it, hey,bind, we want you to participate.

416
00:29:10,075 --> 00:29:12,775
You automatically showed up in there.

417
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:15,043
-Okay -And I can put a little pin there as well

418
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:23,171
If I was gonna do lots of debugging sessions,then I can keep you there as a post to note and watch customer name change over time.

419
00:29:23,171 --> 00:29:28,400
-That's a good one -We can go and see if the model state is valid, it is.

420
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:33,790
-What is the green button, that's a play like -Yeah, go to that point.

421
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,959
Play up to that point, and then stop.

422
00:29:39,025 --> 00:29:42,574
So here, I'm gonna go and Add that customer to the database.

423
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:45,646
Save it to the database,which of course is an in-memory database.

424
00:29:45,646 --> 00:29:52,401
And then we'll redirect Now we had put in slash, but I'm not sure that's gonna work.

425
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:55,473
Should we should we see about their pages, just in case?

426
00:29:55,473 --> 00:29:56,325
-Yeah, see? -Okay.

427
00:29:56,325 --> 00:30:00,677
It's says no page / matches this value.

428
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:02,252
So you have to give the specific name

429
00:30:02,252 --> 00:30:08,798
 I need to say index, which was what our main page is here

430
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:10,654
So index, okay?

431
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:13,662
Now we'll confirm if that that works.

432
00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:22,366
I can hit F5 to go and debug, or I can hit Ctrl+F5,which I like to do, cuz it starts up a little faster,if I know that I'm not gonna do a debugging session.

433
00:30:23,774 --> 00:30:25,118
But this time you hit F5?

434
00:30:25,118 --> 00:30:27,102
I hit Ctrl+F5 to go faster.

435
00:30:28,382 --> 00:30:33,566
Okay, so it redirected me to index but of course I haven't done anything on index that's interesting yet.

436
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:34,398
Okay.

437
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:35,294
That will be the next part, right.

438
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:36,894
So you could also probably send a message saying

439
00:30:36,894 --> 00:30:40,670
I can say customer updated,or whatever.

440
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:43,486
But let's rip out this whole section here.

441
00:30:43,486 --> 00:30:46,046
-Okay, very nice -And put a list of contents.

442
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:47,326
-Okay -Is that cool?

443
00:30:47,326 --> 00:30:50,782
So where's our index?

444
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,558
So this is all this carousel and all this stuff.

445
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:55,902
All the fancy bootstrap.

446
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:58,910
I'm gonna actually collect this.

447
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,446
And then you comment it out?

448
00:31:00,446 --> 00:31:04,030
Actually, no, I'm just gonna be awesome and just like toss it.

449
00:31:04,094 --> 00:31:12,800
Wow. Yeah, but this is a way,if you wanna go hunting for the other side of the div,you can just fold these up, see that this matches this.

450
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:17,545
Fold it up, select over it and toss it.

451
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:22,537
Cool, all right.

452
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:24,905
So let's make our form.

453
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:31,433
And this will be on the index page, right?

454
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:37,425
Yep. We'll have method="post", and this will be a table.

455
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,564
All right.

456
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,721
It's okay to use tables, if it is a table of data.

457
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:47,650
So many people complain about tables being a bad idea.

458
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,472
I think that's kind of funny.

459
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:51,328
[LAUGH] It's a table.

460
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:52,608
It's okay to have a table.

461
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:56,192
So we'll have a head for our table, and we'll have our ID row.

462
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:08,096
-Yep -Oops, and we'll have ID.

463
00:32:09,632 --> 00:32:16,352
Then we'll have Name, we don't really need to show the database ID but for now let's show it.

464
00:32:16,992 --> 00:32:17,952
All right.

465
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,896
Is that cool? So do you have to create a tbody, okay yeah,you're way ahead of me.

466
00:32:20,896 --> 00:32:22,048
No, it's okay. Table body

467
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:26,080
But now I need a row for each.

468
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:34,528
So would you put it in the row, or would you,so I am presumed that you need to go for every contact within.

469
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,000
Exactly.

470
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,352
So I'm gonna have like a FOR SOMETHING HERE.

471
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:54,240
Then a couple of cells, table cells, and then maybe a, I don't know,like a link to edit and a delete button.

472
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:55,264
Yeah.

473
00:32:55,328 --> 00:32:57,952
Okay, you see how I'm kind of sketching it out.

474
00:32:57,952 --> 00:32:59,680
You're sketching it out.

475
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,768
Okay. Wild, what's it called?

476
00:33:00,768 --> 00:33:02,752
Pseudocode or something? Pseudocode.

477
00:33:02,752 --> 00:33:05,696
Yeah. It's a little pseudocode here.

478
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:07,040
So now I wanna say at.

479
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,896
For each yeah. And this is a snippet-

480
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:20,096
-Yeah -Tab, Tab, and then I'm gonna say for each,contact, oops, contact in, in what?

481
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:21,056
In Model.

482
00:33:21,056 --> 00:33:23,232
Now where is our customers?

483
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:31,104
Okay, so remember before when we were doing our create model?

484
00:33:31,104 --> 00:33:34,752
We needed to have the customers come from somewhere.

485
00:33:34,752 --> 00:33:36,352
Yeah. Now we're in a totally different page.

486
00:33:36,352 --> 00:33:38,464
Yeah, so we have to have the customers.

487
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:39,680
We have to have the customers, right?

488
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,112
Yeah. So I'm gonna just take a break here.

489
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:49,472
And I'm gonna jump over to the index model cuz we can't really make our table till we have a little bit more, okay?

490
00:33:49,536 --> 00:33:59,520
And I'm gonna break a couple of cardinal rules that I'm gonna copy paste a little code,because I'm gonna need this similar app database.

491
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,656
This app db context which is gonna save myself a moment of time here.

492
00:34:04,064 --> 00:34:08,736
So we've got our app context, right?

493
00:34:08,736 --> 00:34:10,976
We're gonna have our index page model.

494
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,904
Now before, when we create a customer,we create one customer.

495
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:24,416
But here our model is different cuz we're gonna have a list of customers on this page, right?

496
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:25,504
So our model is different.

497
00:34:25,952 --> 00:34:31,136
And we'll do a get and then a private set so that only we can set it.

498
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:40,736
All right, and then, in the OnGet, We'll say OnGet.

499
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,848
One line below, OnGetAsync, okay.

500
00:34:42,912 --> 00:34:48,480
-OnGetAsync, right? -We're gonna load up customers.

501
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,568
Where do we get them from?

502
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:51,168
The database and this is right there.

503
00:34:51,296 --> 00:34:53,984
We're getting them out of customers.

504
00:34:53,984 --> 00:35:01,400
And then there's this other little bit of thing that you can add on to make things a little bit faster.

505
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,875
You can say AsNoTracking.

506
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:11,496
And I'll show you what that means in a second.

507
00:35:11,496 --> 00:35:16,609
And we're gonna turn these customers into a list of customers.

508
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:19,808
So we're chaining things together,we're saying give me these customers.

509
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:24,032
And we're not gonna keep track of them changing.

510
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:28,960
You see it says disabling change tracking is useful for read-only scenarios.

511
00:35:29,024 --> 00:35:37,152
Change tracking is watching like keeping a track of all the different things you could change so that you know how to make a database update.

512
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:51,040
So if I had a list of customers, and I wanted to watch all of them and change their names, that would give the database system entity framework that we're gonna learn about later all the information it needs about how to only change the bits that change, how to only change the database.

513
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,976
But we're just getting a list, so we're gonna say, don't track these, just give me a list.

514
00:35:58,976 --> 00:36:03,712
So customers, no tracking, give me a list, so that's cool.

515
00:36:04,928 --> 00:36:07,424
And I think we'll leave that like that for now.

516
00:36:07,744 --> 00:36:09,984
We'll go back over to index.

517
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:17,591
And now that model, the page behind us has customers.

518
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:20,840
Look, customers shows up, see, which is nice.

519
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,950
So then I think I can put my tr in here.

520
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,120
And I'm hoping, remember, I said contact, I should say customer.

521
00:36:31,848 --> 00:36:43,944
Customer singular, foreach customer,that means that the customer variable is now available to me customer.Id.

522
00:36:46,025 --> 00:36:50,152
-Everything's connected -Yep, cool, let's try that.

523
00:36:50,152 --> 00:36:57,640
Okay. And then we'll do the rest,cuz I don't know if this is gonna work yet.

524
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,496
Now I'm using an in-memory database, so every time I run this, it's gonna go away.

525
00:36:59,496 --> 00:37:01,352
So it's just a throw away database.

526
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:10,440
-I need to do better -I need to maybe make tests later, and I survived the journey.

527
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:16,456
-You did -Let's see, but as soon as I shut you down, it's gonna be gone.

528
00:37:16,456 --> 00:37:19,784
So if you refresh the page- You're here,you're still there, right?

529
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:22,920
You're there until I close it, until I close this browser.

530
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,464
Or not if I close the browser, pardon me,until I stop the web server.

531
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:33,032
-So, okay -Yeah, thanks, cool, so now we've got create.

532
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:36,680
We should probably put a button down there at the bottom somewhere.

533
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:49,224
We've got some validation, we've got our database,looking at our friends And this is doing a thing called Post Redirect Get.

534
00:37:49,224 --> 00:37:54,792
So I'm here, I hit a post, we do a redirect, and then we do a get, and then we would get this stuff here.

535
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,800
So this is a PRG, Post Redirect Get.

536
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,424
There's lots of articles on the Internet about that.

537
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:05,608
Now let's make a link to theoretically go and edit these things.

538
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:08,369
-Okay -And then we'll have a button for Delete.

539
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,139
These things don't exist on the backend yet,but we can- So yeah,so we don't have an edit page yet.

540
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:13,089
-We don't -Okay. We can make a link

541
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:14,753
Now I could go and put in a link, href.

542
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:16,161
You've done this before a million times.

543
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:21,857
And say /edit and then put in strings and stuff.

544
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:24,289
But remember we talked about how great tag helpers are.

545
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:34,721
-Yeah -What if we went and said asp-page and then we could go and say there's an edit page and then it would figure out what the URL would look like.

546
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:40,801
-Okay -All right, and then it could even express the route a certain way.

547
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:44,385
And we'll talk about routes in a minute.

548
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:48,450
I think it's route-id.

549
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:53,729
And I think we called it customer.Id.

550
00:38:53,729 --> 00:39:01,665
So it's gonna take that customer's id so we want to basically make a page that looks like /edit/2, /edit/3, right?

551
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:10,369
And that's the route id that's gonna get added onto that.

552
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:13,761
Okay, so the next thing you have is a button?

553
00:39:13,761 --> 00:39:22,465
Yeah, we'll do a button type="submit" and this is going to be handled by the page.

554
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:25,409
-Okay -Button's gonna be a little different.

555
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:31,937
The reason that we're doing a button in an href is so you can see the difference between a link,and how links behave, and buttons.

556
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:34,177
A link is gonna navigate somewhere.

557
00:39:34,177 --> 00:39:36,929
-Yep -And a button's gonna cause a post, right?

558
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:41,665
So this will go and be handled by the delete handler.

559
00:39:41,665 --> 00:39:48,705
But we also need that route information, we need that id because we're gonna delete a particular customer.

560
00:39:48,705 --> 00:39:49,985
So you need the content ID, yep.

561
00:39:49,985 --> 00:39:50,945
Customer ID, exactly.

562
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:54,913
All right, and then none of this is hooked up.

563
00:39:54,977 --> 00:40:00,481
So you mentioned something, voice of the people at home,about the button being a post.

564
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:11,041
Yes, it is going to post back and then we're gonna need to handle that behavior differently than the Create page.

565
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,601
So then I'll just put a link at the bottom there for Create.

566
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:14,881
So I'm just gonna hit Refresh.

567
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:20,065
So let's see if the Create- Here's our Create.

568
00:40:21,153 --> 00:40:21,793
Okay.

569
00:40:21,857 --> 00:40:22,689
That still works.

570
00:40:22,689 --> 00:40:25,057
Okay. I hover over that.

571
00:40:25,057 --> 00:40:28,449
Nothing's happening because we don't have an edit.

572
00:40:28,449 --> 00:40:33,505
We never made an edit page, and I hit Delete You should.

573
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:37,665
It's gonna crash cuz it's like I don't know what you're doing, right?

574
00:40:37,857 --> 00:40:43,125
It's just in the middle of something and it's confused cuz that's not what I asked it to do.

575
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,225
Okay, so we've got some fixing up to do.

576
00:40:46,225 --> 00:40:51,460
-Let's try Delete first -Okay. All right, so let's go over here.

577
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:58,450
-We made an OnGet -Let's go and make an OnDelete.

578
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:08,932
-Okay -Same thing as before with an IActionResult, except now we're gonna say on and this is kinda weird, OnPostDelete.

579
00:41:09,764 --> 00:41:20,964
The verb delete is a real HTTP verb,but it's not really often used from a browser's perspective.

580
00:41:20,964 --> 00:41:25,700
It's usually done as it's piggybacked on post.

581
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,732
We use post to pass in basically all kinds of information.

582
00:41:29,732 --> 00:41:34,980
Whenever we hit Submit on a form, we're posting that form.

583
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,884
We're adding in, I think we said, page-handler delete.

584
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,492
So that is gonna be here, OnPostDelete.

585
00:41:44,388 --> 00:41:53,092
And now we're going to say,a customer, customer singular.

586
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:56,484
And we'll go and get that customer out of the database.

587
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:04,600
Before we delete it we gotta go and get it to make sure it's there,I say find, by that ID that got passed in.

588
00:42:05,709 --> 00:42:10,314
So now we gotta check to see if that customer's null or not, cuz if it's null, then we don't even bother.

589
00:42:10,634 --> 00:42:12,746
If it's not null, do something.

590
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,354
And then we can go and Redirect.

591
00:42:17,674 --> 00:42:18,442
To a page.

592
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:20,362
To a page, exactly, thank you.

593
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:24,138
So here, we're gonna remove it from the database.

594
00:42:24,138 --> 00:42:32,983
And we are doing it in a memory database but it doesn't matter because if it was a regular database it would remove it for us, as well, that's what's nice about any framework.

595
00:42:33,495 --> 00:42:34,775
I'm not a very good typer.

596
00:42:35,927 --> 00:42:43,543
So we remove the customer and then we go and we save those changes.

597
00:42:46,935 --> 00:42:51,159
-Okay -And then I would expect it would then redirect to the page,the same page.

598
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:56,598
Yes. And I would expect that it would disappear from that list because it's going to go back to the database and build the list again.

599
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,646
-Does that make sense? -It does, it sure does.

600
00:42:59,646 --> 00:43:01,182
I think that's what it will do.

601
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,022
So we cross our fingers and hope that it works.

602
00:43:07,646 --> 00:43:08,926
And if it doesn't, we learn.

603
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:15,291
-Okay -That's not a good name.

604
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,050
All right, we're deleting you.

605
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,059
Okay, I'm fine with that.

606
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,256
It does work the way you want.

607
00:43:26,256 --> 00:43:27,536
Yeah, it does work

608
00:43:27,536 --> 00:43:28,808
-Fire, fire, fire -Deal, deal, deal.

609
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:32,700
-Fancy pants -But now if we edit it.

610
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,644
Doesn't work because Edit doesn't exist.

611
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:36,796
And it is not there.

612
00:43:36,796 --> 00:43:38,268
All right, so let's go and do edit, then.

613
00:43:38,268 --> 00:43:43,196
So we'll do what you said before, add razor page.

614
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:50,172
Call it Edit, now I know you like routing.

615
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:52,604
Routing is one of your favorite things about ASP.NET.

616
00:43:52,604 --> 00:44:00,284
So this Edit page is gonna be the first time that we've ever had a page that took in information.

617
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:03,548
-Okay -Where does that go to pass in the ID?

618
00:44:04,124 --> 00:44:10,076
-So up there at page? -Right, quote quotes.

619
00:44:10,076 --> 00:44:11,932
Yeah, and curly brackets.

620
00:44:11,932 --> 00:44:15,575
-Yeah -ID.

621
00:44:15,575 --> 00:44:16,919
I mean int.

622
00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:19,378
Okay so the ID is of type int.

623
00:44:19,378 --> 00:44:21,042
Yes. That's the type hint.

624
00:44:21,675 --> 00:44:25,030
So this is saying edit slash 3.

625
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,782
So you'd see it in the browser,that's what it would look like.

626
00:44:27,782 --> 00:44:28,425
Okay.

627
00:44:28,742 --> 00:44:36,125
We have our Edit model, and then here, at the top, we might have Edit, we could actually add a little bit of text here.

628
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:37,341
We could say Edit Customer.

629
00:44:38,493 --> 00:44:41,373
And then we could say- Dash Model?

630
00:44:41,373 --> 00:44:46,045
@Model.Customer, but again, we're not getting IntelliSense,why not?

631
00:44:46,045 --> 00:44:49,693
Because the page model is different for each page.

632
00:44:49,693 --> 00:44:50,589
Exactly.

633
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:54,621
So let's go look at the one for Edit.

634
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:01,789
So I'm gonna.

635
00:45:01,789 --> 00:45:02,855
-You're gonna take, yeah -Borrow again

636
00:45:03,648 --> 00:45:13,440
Certainly I could make another class, a base class, that would pull that AppDBContext in so I wouldn't have to keep copy-pasting that because at some point the copy-pasting becomes tedious.

637
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:18,688
And you want to keep it dry, right.

638
00:45:18,688 --> 00:45:20,224
Don't repeat yourself.

639
00:45:21,632 --> 00:45:23,488
You probably want that to survive the journey right?

640
00:45:23,488 --> 00:45:24,448
Yeah.

641
00:45:24,448 --> 00:45:25,088
Okay.

642
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:31,168
So we want to survive the journey,with bindproperty, okay.

643
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:38,336
So I go back over to our page, and let's see if that worked.

644
00:45:39,552 --> 00:45:40,832
And it did, that's nice.

645
00:45:40,832 --> 00:45:41,856
Yes, it did.

646
00:45:41,856 --> 00:45:51,200
So now we can say, we are Model.Customer.Id, so we can say, Edit Customer for, or whatever.

647
00:45:52,925 --> 00:45:59,840
And then form, and then a form post, and there's some lots of cool ways to make your forms easier to write.

648
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:06,179
If you find writing forms tedious, there's a really great way to write forms that is called Emmet.

649
00:46:07,325 --> 00:46:09,123
-What is Emmet? -You've never heard of Emmet?

650
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:14,122
E-m-m-e-t, it's like the name, the person's name Emmet.

651
00:46:14,122 --> 00:46:20,027
Okay. And it's a way of describing what you want like a feel like trt.

652
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:30,091
TR TD times three and then you'd hit tab and then it would go and expand it, it's a way to write tags for HTML really really fast.

653
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:37,046
-Is it built in? -It's built into Visual Studio code but it is not built in to Visual Studio yet.

654
00:46:37,174 --> 00:46:41,270
-Okay -Notice how I got this here, soon as I said ASP net four.

655
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:44,662
Yeah, it gave you [CROSSTALK] Input four, rather.

656
00:46:44,662 --> 00:46:46,774
It got that, this is really nice, right?

657
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:52,342
So I can go and fill out these forms really quickly and I don't have to worry about that's gonna happen on the server side.

658
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:58,294
Okay, so then we'll say a label, and this is a label also for.

659
00:46:58,294 --> 00:46:59,574
The customer.

660
00:46:59,574 --> 00:47:10,518
Customer's name which is nice and then we'll say, give you another div, And then within there we'll have an input.

661
00:47:10,582 --> 00:47:15,638
For Customer.Name.

662
00:47:18,134 --> 00:47:20,374
And then you can do the validation again, right?

663
00:47:20,374 --> 00:47:26,646
Yeah I'll do some, but I can do validation two different ways.

664
00:47:26,646 --> 00:47:27,926
I could do the validation summary or we can do it like this, which is nice.

665
00:47:27,926 --> 00:47:30,166
And what are the key differences?

666
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:32,854
This one is, you have total control of what it looks like.

667
00:47:32,854 --> 00:47:34,710
You can put it anywhere up or down.

668
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:37,846
Okay. And this is just a bulleted list that's a roll up.

669
00:47:37,846 --> 00:47:39,702
Okay. Of all of the stuff.

670
00:47:39,702 --> 00:47:42,262
Totally up to you how you wanna do things.

671
00:47:44,182 --> 00:47:46,934
This is all inside of a form, right?

672
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:48,150
So you want to save it, right?

673
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:51,094
Yeah, we're going to need a save button.

674
00:47:53,526 --> 00:48:04,598
-Exactly -So we'll put our button at the bottom,and it's just a regular old submit, nothing fancy about it.

675
00:48:04,662 --> 00:48:05,430
And it'll say save.

676
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,454
We're going to want to load this up and save it.

677
00:48:06,454 --> 00:48:07,606
And have validation.

678
00:48:07,606 --> 00:48:14,070
We've done all that very nicely like this, and we just wanna confirm like you said on the backend that we do the right thing.

679
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:17,270
So on the get, actually let's do this.

680
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,598
Let's run it first and then we'll try it again because right now we haven't hooked anything up.

681
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:22,838
We haven't got it from the database we haven't updated from the database.

682
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:25,206
But I would expect the links to at least work.

683
00:48:25,206 --> 00:48:29,366
Yeah. Cuz now there is an Edit page.

684
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:33,846
If there's not, then maybe I forgot something.

685
00:48:34,294 --> 00:48:36,342
Okay, look in the corner there.

686
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:39,798
-Okay -It's kind of hard for me to do that.

687
00:48:39,798 --> 00:48:45,558
I can take a screenshot but I can't really take a screenshot.

688
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,502
-Let's do this -We'll take a snipping tool.

689
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,894
Give it a delay of two seconds.

690
00:48:52,982 --> 00:48:55,478
You're that fast? I am.

691
00:48:59,638 --> 00:49:07,382
So Edit/1 right,so the route got built by the fact that it was in the Edit.

692
00:49:07,382 --> 00:49:09,878
And then you had added that ID at the top there.

693
00:49:09,878 --> 00:49:17,174
So this is nice because we didn't have to hard code what a link looked like.

694
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:18,326
That's really important.

695
00:49:18,326 --> 00:49:22,358
We said, make me a link that takes me here.

696
00:49:22,358 --> 00:49:25,814
We didn't say make me a link that looks like this.

697
00:49:25,814 --> 00:49:26,902
Nope.

698
00:49:26,902 --> 00:49:27,670
That's nice.

699
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:31,638
And if we changed our things later, then it would change for us, which is nice.

700
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:37,142
So here,if I click on that, I assume it'll just do, yeah, nothing.

701
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:40,086
So it's like, blegh, I don't have anything there.

702
00:49:40,086 --> 00:49:47,638
It doesn't know about customer yet because we have the bind,but we never loaded the customers.

703
00:49:47,638 --> 00:49:56,982
So let's go and do our stuff again, we're gonna have our action result and here we're gonna say OnGet, of course,int id, that's gonna get passed in automatically because of the way we set up our routes, that's nice.

704
00:49:56,982 --> 00:50:14,710
By default, will just return to page, but here we'll say Customer, the one above Go and get it from the database.

705
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:23,542
And find it, okay, Yeah, so FindAsync, kind of a standard thing, you could pass in more complicated queries, and get it other ways.

706
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:24,566
If it's null, freak out.

707
00:50:24,566 --> 00:50:31,926
-Right? -Yeah. If (Customers == null),I don't know, let's put them back to index.

708
00:50:31,926 --> 00:50:34,486
It's Customer, right?

709
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:36,534
Yes, pardon me, Customer.

710
00:50:38,646 --> 00:50:54,390
Okay, RedirectToPage("/Index"); a lot of typing,but we don't wanna hide anything from you.

711
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:55,670
Keeping it 100.

712
00:50:55,670 --> 00:51:05,398
We are absolutely keeping it 100,so this should that up and give us a form, with the customer in it.

713
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:10,966
Let's see if it does, cuz we added that bind property,which you said, what did you call it?

714
00:51:10,966 --> 00:51:11,664
Surviving the journey.

715
00:51:11,664 --> 00:51:13,584
Surviving the journey.

716
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:16,929
You saw that interest movie really survive the journey.

717
00:51:16,929 --> 00:51:18,337
Don't tell me what happens at the end?

718
00:51:18,337 --> 00:51:18,850
So I've been.

719
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:19,810
I don't wanna know.

720
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,090
Okay, and then I hit Edit, and then it works.

721
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:22,308
Exactly. Right.

722
00:51:22,308 --> 00:51:25,874
-So what happens if you change it around? -If I change it

723
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:30,610
probably nothing Right,cuz we don't have our post.

724
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:31,225
Exactly.

725
00:51:31,225 --> 00:51:33,050
Exactly, so we've got our get.

726
00:51:34,834 --> 00:51:40,146
But we don't have our post.

727
00:51:40,146 --> 00:51:42,322
You could kind of copy that.

728
00:51:42,322 --> 00:51:58,642
Yes, I think there's a way to actually link that whole thing quickly, but we'll say, OnPostAsync All right,the very end we will do that Redirect.

729
00:51:58,642 --> 00:51:59,794
To the index page?

730
00:51:59,794 --> 00:52:01,266
To the index page, exactly.

731
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:07,538
-Okay -What do we do?

732
00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:09,458
Well, we've got that model state valid issue.

733
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,314
Yeah, so if not model.

734
00:52:11,314 --> 00:52:15,922
Not ModelState.IsValid.

735
00:52:15,986 --> 00:52:17,970
Yeah, we want it to return to the page.

736
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:23,474
-Okay -Aah, Page

737
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:28,338
See, if you try to type too fast to impress people, and it just ends up making you look silly.

738
00:52:28,402 --> 00:52:31,538
Okay, now this one is an interesting one.

739
00:52:31,538 --> 00:52:33,074
Cuz you want to attach it to the database.

740
00:52:33,074 --> 00:52:36,914
Yeah, so what we're doing is,we're modifying something that's all ready in the database.

741
00:52:36,978 --> 00:52:41,586
So what we're trying to do is take this customer that we are recurrently editing.

742
00:52:41,586 --> 00:52:43,506
So it's in a cart state.

743
00:52:43,506 --> 00:52:53,554
Attach that customer in the state of it in the database,we're going to mark that as Modified.

744
00:52:53,554 --> 00:52:54,770
And this bit here.

745
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,370
It shouldn't be there, yeah.

746
00:52:56,370 --> 00:53:00,466
Add the using statement, there we go.

747
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,898
And now it's turned blue, okay.

748
00:53:02,898 --> 00:53:12,562
Now, we don't know if it's going to work, because someone else could be simultaneously editing at the same time.

749
00:53:12,562 --> 00:53:13,586
Exactly, so you want to do a try and catch.

750
00:53:13,586 --> 00:53:16,530
Can do a try, maybe it'll work, maybe it won't.

751
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:24,530
And the exception that we're gonna catch for,is called aDbUpdateConcurrencyException.

752
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:26,130
So just in case someone's doing-

753
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:27,922
If someone's in there at the same time- Exactly what it says.

754
00:53:27,922 --> 00:53:31,383
Exactly what it is. Okay, so you're going to wait for changes?

755
00:53:31,383 --> 00:53:38,675
Go on 'await' and say SaveChangesAsync, and presumably that'll work fine.

756
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,819
If it doesn't- We'll have to throw an exception?

757
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:50,027
Now there's different arguments about the right way to do this, but for now I'm gonna go and say, Customer, and this is kind of cool.

758
00:53:50,411 --> 00:53:54,750
Customer.Id, see how I'm getting IntelliSense inside the string?

759
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,047
We can do whatever we want to about that concurrency exception, maybe even pass it in as an inner exception.

760
00:54:04,047 --> 00:54:10,831
But the fact is, actually, that would be a good idea,we'll pass that in, along for the ride.

761
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:16,591
We wanna give a message to somebody that bad stuff has happened.

762
00:54:17,807 --> 00:54:23,631
All right,that should be, I think we always gonna create only.

763
00:54:23,631 --> 00:54:26,383
-And we do -We've done the create.

764
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,903
-Let's go see -I think the create was a post.

765
00:54:29,903 --> 00:54:33,359
-Yeah -The read is the for loop.

766
00:54:34,127 --> 00:54:39,695
The delete was also a post, but with a delete sidecar,along for the ride.

767
00:54:40,399 --> 00:54:48,591
-So, Create, Dan -Break points from before.

768
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:55,759
-Yeah. I will remove those -I think you still have, okay.

769
00:54:55,823 --> 00:54:57,231
Continue, we'll bump into them if we have more.

770
00:54:57,231 --> 00:54:58,895
-Fancy pants -Beyonce.

771
00:54:58,959 --> 00:55:06,703
-That's a good point -Edit

772
00:55:08,687 --> 00:55:11,311
-Carter -Carter Knowles.

773
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,751
-Yeah -Don't get it twisted.

774
00:55:16,815 --> 00:55:22,447
-Delete everyone else who is not worthy -So

775
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:25,071
-See, it works -It does work.

776
00:55:25,135 --> 00:55:30,063
There you go, taking care of business, cool.

777
00:55:30,063 --> 00:55:34,223
-So, let's think about that -So, that's pretty sweet.

778
00:55:34,223 --> 00:55:41,711
-It is -If we go back, and just kind of review particularly,this bit here we've got our edit.

779
00:55:41,775 --> 00:55:47,471
With the route id where we did not see

780
00:55:47,535 --> 00:55:49,135
-Where are we reaching -out right now?

781
00:55:49,135 --> 00:55:50,863
I'm sorry this is index.

782
00:55:50,863 --> 00:55:52,847
-Okay -Right?

783
00:55:52,847 --> 00:55:56,751
So here we got an edit.

784
00:55:56,815 --> 00:56:06,530
I wanna point out how it looks in the code, and then compare that to how it looks ultimately in the code, right?

785
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:11,075
When it makes it all the way back to the browser.

786
00:56:13,314 --> 00:56:15,746
-See? -It's in.

787
00:56:15,746 --> 00:56:21,314
So that came from, this seems like a little more.

788
00:56:21,314 --> 00:56:22,338
You might be asking yourself,why you don't just hard code that?

789
00:56:22,338 --> 00:56:25,794
But routes change, pages change, things get moved around..

790
00:56:25,794 --> 00:56:35,650
Now, this one is a little bit more interesting here,because you might have multiple buttons on the page that do different stuff.

791
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:39,490
So then, you can give them a handler name. Right?

792
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:40,514
I could have delete.

793
00:56:40,514 --> 00:56:43,778
I could have bold face Beyonce, I could have all caps, right?

794
00:56:43,842 --> 00:56:44,802
We could have whatever.

795
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:49,026
You're not limited to one button.

796
00:56:49,026 --> 00:56:59,010
A submit button can have, you could have multiple submits,still passing numbers, like in this case id.

797
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:01,954
-Yeah -And this is an ampersand.

798
00:57:01,954 --> 00:57:06,946
-Yeah -Multiple handlers, delete, promote whatever.

799
00:57:06,946 --> 00:57:08,162
-Save -Save exactly

800
00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:18,530
-Okay -And what's cool about that, is that then that word delete If we look at the behind is this word.

801
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:27,362
So I think you could even go like on post "foo" async, or whatever, as long as it lines up because you're saying on post and then some handler.

802
00:57:27,362 --> 00:57:29,090
-Yes -That cool?

803
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:37,026
That is cool. And the handler is literally you could say Let me stop our debugging here.

804
00:57:42,978 --> 00:57:45,090
You gonna try the foo?

805
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,098
Right I can do whatever, it doesn't matter.

806
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:50,978
That word is totally up to you.

807
00:57:50,978 --> 00:57:53,410
So I don't need to test that.

808
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,738
-You just trust me -You don't trust me?

809
00:57:56,738 --> 00:57:58,466
-Yeah, sure -All right let's test it then.

810
00:57:58,466 --> 00:58:05,890
-Let's test it -That gives you a lot of flexibility with buttons, so I say foo right there.

811
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:09,154
-I go over here -We say foo.

812
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:11,138
And there you go.

813
00:58:11,138 --> 00:58:12,034
So while that's loading?

814
00:58:12,034 --> 00:58:13,058
What were you gonna say?

815
00:58:13,058 --> 00:58:15,810
No, no, no, I trust you ish.

816
00:58:15,874 --> 00:58:17,986
-Trust you ish? -Yeah.

817
00:58:17,986 --> 00:58:20,802
That's pretty good, I'll take that.

818
00:58:21,058 --> 00:58:26,498
Let's go and add people.

819
00:58:29,826 --> 00:58:31,554
-Okay -That was foo.

820
00:58:31,554 --> 00:58:33,410
How did f oo know it was delete?

821
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:38,658
Because it doesn't matter that it was named Foo.

822
00:58:38,722 --> 00:58:40,386
It's just a handler name.

823
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:50,425
And if we confirm it Did I pass it?

824
00:58:50,882 --> 00:58:52,546
-Nope -This is create, sorry.

825
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:56,770
There you go there's a delete.

826
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:00,418
Okay see it says handler equals foo.

827
00:59:00,418 --> 00:59:06,434
-Yes, okay, yes -And then, I just happened to name this handler foo also.

828
00:59:06,434 --> 00:59:12,770
-Yes, yeah -So the point is, it lined up.

829
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:14,114
And that's how you can have unlimited verbs.

830
00:59:14,114 --> 00:59:17,506
And then at that point, it just did the thing and removed it from the database.

831
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:26,338
-Cool? -Cool. So,we saw lots of different handlers, like gets and posts, and custom handlers like delete.

832
00:59:26,338 --> 00:59:33,954
-Yeah -We saw some tag helpers, that will generate buttons and links for us.

833
00:59:33,954 --> 00:59:36,322
-We saw layout pages -We saw validation.

834
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:39,842
We saw validation both summary and individual.

835
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:45,730
-And yeah -Yeah lots of little bit about routing and a little bit more detail.

836
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:51,490
We saw routing,and then specifically, actually one important thing we can point out about routing as well.

837
00:59:51,554 --> 01:00:00,578
If I click edit Did we, I shut the app down again.

838
01:00:00,578 --> 01:00:01,858
You had said ID:int

839
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:09,154
-Yes -Where int was a number, correct?

840
01:00:09,154 --> 01:00:12,418
It would be interesting.

841
01:00:12,418 --> 01:00:19,010
So just confirm that, if we put in Submit Query, edit, she is one.

842
01:00:21,442 --> 01:00:24,322
Put in an ID that is not an int.

843
01:00:24,322 --> 01:00:31,554
You should get a You simply get a 404,you don't get a 500.

844
01:00:31,554 --> 01:00:32,770
It's not an error.

845
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:33,922
It's a route that doesn't exist.

846
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,778
We don't have an edit that takes a string.

847
01:00:35,778 --> 01:00:43,074
So that's another really,really important thing to point out about routing, and why that little bit up there was so significant?

848
01:00:43,074 --> 01:00:52,226
And then soon, in the intermediate sections, we will learn a little bit more about web APIs, and url, and mixing and matching pages as well Yeah.

849
01:00:52,226 --> 01:00:54,402
Can we take a break and come back with a little bit of logging?

850
01:00:54,402 --> 01:00:55,554
Yes we will
