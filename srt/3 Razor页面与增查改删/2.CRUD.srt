00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:07,123
Hey friends, we're glad you're still with us here at Microsoft Virtual Academy as we do our intro to ASP.NET Core.
大家好，很高兴你仍然关注我们微软虚拟学院，我们会继续介绍 ASP.NET Core

2
00:00:07,123 --> 00:00:09,672
We're learning all about razor pages and our application.
我们将继续学习关于 razor 页面和应用程序的内容

3
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,371
-This module will be a little longer -Yes it will
-这模块将花比较长的时间去进行 -是的

4
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:16,975
And it will probably have us making some mistakes together,and that's okay.
它可能会误导我们犯一些错误,但这没关系

5
00:00:17,257 --> 00:00:19,219
And we're gonna try not to hide anything from you.
我们要尽量不遗漏下任何东西

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:24,339
We are following the documentation as we hope that are, and maybe you can follow along.
我们会跟着文档去一步步操作,你也要这么做，并且可能会花更长时间

7
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:27,987
Pause, try stuff out, and maybe Google with Bing.
暂停一下,尝试去做,也许谷歌和必应一下是少不了的

8
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:28,883
Google with Bing.
Google 和 Bing~

9
00:00:28,883 --> 00:00:30,547
If you have trouble and get stuck.
如果你有麻烦,卡住了

10
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:34,323
Yeah, and we will have links to the documentation right underneath this recording.
没关系,我们可以通过链接到文档对下的内容去了解详情（这个要去官网看呦~）

11
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:39,281
All right, so we're gonna try to make a CRUD page.
好吧,所以我们要试着做一个 CRUD 页面

12
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:39,971
What is CRUD?
什么是 CRUD?

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,777
Create,read, update, delete.
创建、读取、更新、删除

14
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:54,675
All right, so a CRUD application maps verbs from CRUD to verbs that we're used to using,like get is a get, so it would be like a read.
All right, so a CRUD application maps verbs from CRUD to verbs that we're used to using,like get is a get, so it would be like a read.

15
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:57,358
And if you're gonna create something, it would be a post.
如果你要创造一些数据,这就要用到 post 请求

16
00:00:57,358 --> 00:01:06,126
So you'd fill out a form, you'd hit submit, and it would post the data, that's a create Then you can maybe read it back and look at in edit page or then maybe delete it.
当你在填写表格时,点击提交, post 请求将发送数据,经过一个创建过程后你可以在页面看到它,同样也可以编辑或删除

17
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:12,718
So if we succeed, we'll have the simple form,maybe create some customers, put them in a fake database And we'll be okay
如果顺利的话,我们会通过简单的形式创造一些虚拟信息,并把它们放在一个假的数据库,我们有信心~

18
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:16,625
Yeah, and I will be learning more about databases in the intermediate course as well
是的,我们以后将会学习更多关于数据库中间层的内容

19
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,606
Yes,well like a whole section on databases.

20
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:20,846
So for now, we're gonna be doing it in an in-memory database.
所以现在,我们会在内存中创建一个数据库

21
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:23,598
Okay, so let's do the best we can.
好吧,让我们尽我们所能来做吧

22
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:26,862
We're gonna use the same web application one that we created before.
我们将使用与之前创建的 web 应用相同的程序

23
00:01:26,862 --> 00:01:39,225
We saw in the previous modules where we added MVC, but of course all of that stuff was added for us because we went File > New Project,and we picked Web Application, all right?
我们看下之前的模块,我们添加了 MVC ,当然我们之所以这么做是因为我们通过 文件>新项目 ,选择了 Web 应用程序,对吧?

24
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:44,782
So here in configure services, we've got AddMvc.
所以在配置服务,我们加上 AddMvc

25
00:01:44,782 --> 00:01:47,672
But we're gonna make our little in-memory database here.
但我们需要有一个小的内存数据库

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,358
We're gonna say services.AddDbContext<>
我们在这里输入 services.AddDbContext<>

27
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:55,150
Yeah, and give it name
好的，给它一个名字

28
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,030
And we gonna create a thing called AppDbContext.

33
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:12,878
Do you wanna go and generate one of those?

34
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:14,670
I wanna go ahead and say yes.
我们选择,是的

35
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,190
So it's gone and done that, and we'll deal with that in a minute.
这样系统会去生成了,我们会在一分钟内处理掉它

36
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,414
And again, I will very likely make mistakes, so you'll bear with me I hope.
我很有可能再次犯错误,所以我希望你能原谅我

37
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:27,214
I opened up the parentheses there.
我在括号中添加内容

38
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,942
And I'm gonna pass in some options.

-We need to add -why is that not showing up?

44
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:47,806
So we need to add the entity framework.

00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:49,150
So we need to use
所以我们需要使用

46
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,006
And I probably should have added that first, and
可能应该说是补充,第一点

47
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:52,158
I would have gotten IntelliSense.
我们利用智能感知

48
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:53,758
-True -Let's try that.
-尝试 -让我们试一下

49
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:56,254

Look, you see that little arrow there that's pointing down?
看,你看到那个向下的小箭头?

52
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:19,166
That means that this method came in was included by the fact that we just did that UseIn.
 这意味着,该方法包括了我们刚才添加进来的 UseIn

00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,425
That's called an extension method,it's along for the ride.

00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:27,614
No, it wasn't.

56
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:37,406
Add InMemoryDatabase, some name All right,And then we look at the squiggle and we worry.
添加 InMemoryDatabase 的名字,下面有一个曲线，真叫人担心

57
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:39,582
Does the squiggle mean something?
下划线的意思是什么？

58
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,550
So, here it's saying AddDbContext.

00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,598
Well, we never really went and did anything with that AddDbContext.
好吧,我们从没有真正去引用 AddDbContext。

What I'm trying to zoom and make it helpful for you, I end up making it worse for myself.
我想放的更大一点,让你能看清楚,但是那样我自己就很难受了

That's why it's squiggled out.
这就是为什么会出现下划线

77
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:54,393
And then we do a getter, setter, get ; set, okay?

不,我不想要这些

92
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:37,464
But if I was doing something with JSON or doing something with some technology that I knew I will need the NuGet packages, later it will go get it for me.
但如果我通过 json 或其他一些技术,我知道我需要 NuGet 包,之后它就会把它给我

93
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:40,792
So I'm gonna say generate in new file, that seems reasonable.

但我可以点击这个小标签在这里拓展窗口,现在我已经跳转进来了

But I'm just gonna use prop for now.
但是现在我要用道具

117
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,584
So this is customer, so customers have an ID,a unique ID.
这是客户,所以客户有一个ID、一个惟一的ID

118
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:18,184

120
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,392
We'll start with name for now, but should name have some constraints?
我们从名字开始,但名字应该有限制吗?

121
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:28,040
It should,we have an idea of data annotation.

There's annotation on that data, yes.
有注释的数据,是的

123
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:33,096
So one of the things is that you probably want someone to enter their name, right?
要做的事情中有一件事就是想让某人输入他们的名字,对吧?

124
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:38,408

我们想强迫他们，我们想强迫他们,所以我们要确保某种需要,对吗?

125
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:43,656
So required, and I'm putting that as a notation here and I'm gonna hit Ctrl+dot, again.
所以需要我把这作为一个符号,点击 Ctrl+. 一下

126
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:50,696
When you learn that these things exist and you're thinking about them rather than typing in all this stuff for the using,you're just gonna type required.
当你学习这些东西的存在和你思考他们而不是输入使用所有这些东西,你就需要类型

127
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:54,600
Hit Ctrl+dot, and then hit Enter.
点击 Ctrl+. 然后回车

128
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:00,296
Line 1 just appeared there And then we'll force the length as well.
1号线就出现了,然后我们也会迫使长度

129
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:05,032
We'll be silly for a moment, we'll say a length of 10.
我想一会儿,设定长度为10吧

130
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:06,824
That's not a very good length.

131
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:08,104
That is not a good length at all.
这不是一个合适的长度

132
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,024
But that might allow us to do some validation later.
我们先用它做一些验证

133
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:12,072
And then we'll change it to a longer length.
然后我们会改变它长的长度

134
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:15,592
All right, so let's back up for a second and see what we did here.
好吧,让我们回到了第二个,看看我们在这里做什么

135
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:20,520
So we have in our start up an InMemoryDatabase.
所以我们在启动一个 InMemoryDatabase

136
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:22,824
Not a SQLserver or a.
没有 SQL Server

137
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:25,256
Whatever just in memory database.
无论在内存数据库

138
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:37,401
We have a beginnings of a customer, unique ID and a name Some annotations on it, and then a little class here that's kind of empty.
我们有一个客户开始,惟一 ID 和名称一些注释,然后一个小类,是空的

139
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:43,850
That is our a list of customers and actually what's customer Singular here.
这是我们的 Customer 列表实际上这里的 Customer 有点奇怪

140
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,578
-Yeah. -That should be customers.
-是的. -应该是客户

141
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:49,375
-Okay, because, you have a set. -This is a set of customers.
-好吧,因为这必须要去设置 -这是客户的设置

142
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:54,474
So the one thing, how are we going to see this information?
还有一件事,我们怎么看到这个信息?

143
00:08:54,474 --> 00:09:01,514
Well, we're going to need to probably put some in the database and then,once we have them in the database, list them out.
我们可能需要在数据库,然后放一些,一旦我们让他们在数据库列表中显示出来

144
00:09:01,514 --> 00:09:02,922
Like how are we going to visually see it?
我们如何直观地看到?

145
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:05,610
Yeah, so there's a bit of a chicken and the egg problem there.
是的,像一个鸡和蛋的问题

146
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,898
Do we make the listing page first and list them out?
首先我们做清单页面列表出来吗?

147
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:12,202
But we really can't cuz we don't have any.
但我们不能，因为我们没有

148
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:13,802
-You don't anything, yeah. -Or we make a create page first.
-我们啥都没有呀 -或者我们先做一个页面出来

149
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:17,194
-So it's CRUD. -We'll do the C first, okay?
-这是 CRUD. -我们先把创建功能实现

150
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:20,266
-So over in -The pages folder.
-所以在 -页面文件夹

151
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:23,274
Pages, let's do create.
页面,我们来创建

152
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:26,282
Now, we're not going to say new file like we did before.
现在,我们不会说像我们之前做的新文件

153
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:29,546
No, you're going to create a new Razor Page or if you go to New File.
不,你要创建一个新的 Razor 页面或者如果你创建新文件

154
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:30,954
Let me do that again.
让我做一遍

155
00:09:30,954 --> 00:09:34,026
Right click and I have two choices I have new.
右键点击和我有新有两个选择

156
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:35,818
-And then. -Page or I can say item.
-然后 -页面或者说项目

157
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:36,650
Yeah, New Item.
是的,新项目

158
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,594
And they should be the option to pick Razor Page.
他们应该选择 Razor 页面的选项

159
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:43,306
Right, so you got a couple different options here and this is all the different things that you could make.
对,所以你有几个不同的选项,这是你可以做的所有的事情

160
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:56,685
I'm gonna go and right click and say add Razor page, and I wanna point out that I'm not gonna do it for this because it will be a little bit cheating but after we're all done, first, we make you suffer.
我要和右单击,添加 Razor 页面,我想指出,我不会做这个,因为它将一点欺骗但我们都完成后,首先,我们让你受苦

161
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:59,053
And then we show you the easy way And then we show you the easy way
然后我们告诉你最简单的方法,然后我们告诉你最简单的方法

162
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:07,462
We could create that model and say Razor page is using entity framework CRUD, and then it will then scaffold or generate.
我们可以创建模型和 Razor 页面 CRUD是使用实体框架,然后将支架或生成

163
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:10,342
-Every single -All the hard parts that we're about to do.
-每一个 -所有困难的部分,我们要做的

164
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:14,825
But it's more fun to do, no no,it's more fun to do it ourselves, don't you think?
但它更有趣,不不,是更有趣的做自己,你不觉得吗?

165
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:17,958
-All right. -All right, lets do it ourselves.
-好吧 -好吧,让我们自己做吧

166
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,006
People can fast forward if they don't like it.
如果你们不喜欢，他们可以快进

167
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,294
The page name would be create.
页面名称将被创建

168
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:26,854
Uh-huh, and then we're gonna use a layout, we saw that.
我们会使用布局，我们看到

169
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:31,014
And then, here it says Generate PageModel,that's that code behind of that page model.
然后，在这里生成 PageModel ，那就是那个页面模型背后的代码。

170
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:34,075
We could say no and then do that in line, if we wanted to.
如果我们愿意，我们可以选择“不”，然后就这样做

171
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,886
All right. So let's see if that works.
好的。让我们看看这是否可行

172
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,425
Thinking, thinking, thinking.
思考思考

173
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,966
We're gonna watch in the right hand side here as create should appear.
我们将在右边观看，因为创造应该出现

174
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:45,590
And sticking well because it's doing quite a bit of scaffolding.
而且粘得很好，因为它做了很多脚手架

175
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:50,902
Well, it's scaffolding up some workforce but it's also gonna build the application to see if it still builds.
嗯，它正在架起一些员工的架子，但它也将构建应用程序来查看它是否仍在构建

176
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,422
And if it's running a scarf-folder.
如果它正在运行一个 scarf 文件夹

177
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:57,650
And scar folder is something that you can go on a nd read about and write your own if you feel like it.
SCAR文件夹是一种你可以去读和写你自己的东西，如果你喜欢它

178
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,875
So here we gotta create.
所以我们必须创造

179
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:03,574
-So let's see what we have in there -Let's see it gives us a page
-让我们看看里面有什么 -让我们看看它给了我们一个页面

180
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:17,525
It gave us a default model, a title, looks like a header, and then some validation scripts, and then presumably we can just start typing our pages or whatever.
它给了我们一个默认模型，一个标题，看起来像一个标题，然后是一些验证脚本，然后大概我们可以开始打字我们的页面或其他什么

181
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:23,478
Let's look at the backend,It made a create model that has a get.
让我们看看后端，它创建了一个具有 get 的创建模型

182
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:26,422
So this is the function that happens when we get stuff.
这就是我们得到东西时的作用

183
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:27,254
Okay.
好的

184
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,198
All right, so we're gonna need to make form code.
好的，所以我们需要制作表格代码

185
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:36,650
All right, so form that would have actually just one entry?
好吧，那么表格实际上只有一个条目？

186
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,974
Yeah, so we'll say enter your name, figure, all right.
是的，所以我们说输入你的名字，数字，好吧

187
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:44,079
And who knows if this will work, again, we're gonna learn.
谁知道这是否可行，我们将再次学习

188
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,431
Now, this is interesting, noticed that when I typed form Why is it in purple?
现在，这很有趣，注意到当我输入表格为什么它是紫色的？

189
00:11:48,431 --> 00:12:02,433
Turns purple, so that is a tag helper, this is some related elements that are gonna be on the server for processing so the server knows about purple elements, and ill do some processing of them.
变成紫色，所以这是一个标签助手，这是一些相关的元素，将在服务器上进行处理，这样服务器就知道紫色元素，并且我会对它们进行一些处理

190
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:12,545
Typically when you're in HTML, you have like a P tag or an image tag or div, and that's just strings that get sent off to the client.
通常，当你在HTML中时，你有一个P标签或一个图像标签或div，而这只是被发送到客户端的字符串
191
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:22,785
But when we're generating this stuff on the server side,there might be an opportunity for ASP.NET Core to improve it,to change it, to add stuff.
但是当我们在服务器端生成这些东西时，ASP.NET核心可能会有机会改进它，改变它，添加一些东西

192
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:24,385
So it knows about form.
所以它知道形式

193
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:27,969
Form is a magic tag and we can go and type things like this,you see it says asp colon.
表格是一个魔术标签，我们可以去键入这样的东西，你看到它显示 ASP 冒号

194
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:33,281
Yeah, so is that indication that that is a tag helper or some sort of action?
是的，这是一个标记助手还是某种动作？

195
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:36,025
Right these things aren't html.
这些东西不是HTML

196
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:37,569
-No -Those are tag helpers
-并不是 -那些是标签助手

197
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:43,265
You'll never see asp hyphen something being sent all the way out to the browser.
你将永远不会看到 ASP 连字符被发送到浏览器

198
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:45,953
These are not HTML,They're hints to the server.
这些不是HTML，它们是服务器的提示

199
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:52,225
So if when we run this application, and we go into the F12 tools, we will not see- You shouldn't see those.
因此，如果我们运行这个应用程序，我们进入F12工具，我们将看不到-你不应该看到那些

200
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:53,300
-Okay -Exactly
-Okay -确切地

201
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,750
So we're gonna say form, this is gonna be basic method= a,yep see Get, post, put, delete
所以我们要说形式，这是基本方法= a ，看 GET,POST,PUT,delete

202
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,422
We'll say post So we're gonna go and post.
我们会用 post ，所以我们要使用 go 和 post

203
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,761
Here's the end of our form.
这是我们形式的结束

204
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,025
Say div, name, and then we'll need a text box.
div 名字，然后我们需要一个文本框

205
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:09,313
Yep so some sort of input tag.
是的，某种输入标签

206
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:11,617
Yep input,Now, this is interesting.
现在输入，这很有趣

207
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,441
We could do an input tag the way we usually do or we could say ASP.NET4.
我们可以按通常的方式做输入标记，也可以说是ASP.NET4

208
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:22,817
-Okay -And we're gonna say Customer.Name.
-Okay -我们要用 Customer.Name

209
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:25,313
-Okay -See how it's all purple?
-Okay -看它怎么都是紫色的？

210
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,825
That ASP 4 is gonna look at that model, okay?
ASP 4会使用那个模型，好吗？

211
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:34,950
Now, it's saying here, I don't know what a Customer is.
现在，这里说的是，我不知道 Customer 是什么

212
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,441
What's going on with that?
这是怎么回事？

213
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,465
It's never heard of Customer before.
以前从来没有听说过 Customer

214
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,923
We'll come back and fix that in a second.
我们一会儿再来解决

215
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:45,225
Then we'll have an input for submitting that form, okay?
然后我们输入一张表格，好吗？

216
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:48,735
But we have a problem here,where it doesn't know what Customer is.
但我们在这里遇到了一个问题，就是不知道 Customer 是什么

217
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,625
What is the model for this page?
这个页面的模型是什么？

218
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,687
-Right, it's the -The Create
-好的，这是 -是创建

219
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:57,275
CreateModel, so let's go look at that.
CreateModel, 让我们来看一看

220
00:13:58,225 --> 00:13:59,871
Peek into Definition, okay.
查看一下定义，好的

221
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:01,343
I wanna point out how I'm moving around.
我想指出我是怎么四处走动的

222
00:14:01,343 --> 00:14:05,300
I'm right clicking and saying Go To Definition is also a hotkey for that.
我右击，对此定义一个热键

223
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:11,839
So this is an important reminder, just as a programmer,you don't wanna necessarily find yourself going over and looking around all the files all the time.
这是一个重要的提醒，就像一个程序员一样，你不需要发现自己到处都在浏览所有的文件

224
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,719
-You can navigate -To it, right?
-你可以导航 -对吧？

225
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:17,750
To it directly, you can navigate logically, as they say.
直接说，你可以像他们所说的那样在逻辑上进行导航

226
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,183
-Okay, all right. -Did you?
-Okay, 好吧. -你呢？

227
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,871
-Cut something out from -Yeah
-从这里剪掉 -好的

228
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:25,855
-Okay -Great.
-好的 -不错.

229
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:28,275
-There we go -I cut out CreateModel, thank you.
-我们继续 -我剪下了 CreateModel ，谢谢你

230
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:36,725
Right so, our create model is gonna need to know about customers, because that's gonna show up on the page.
好的那么，我们的创建模型需要了解客户，因为这会出现在页面上

231
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:39,675
So public Customer, that's a type.
所以公众客户，这是一种类型

232
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:42,990
-That's a name -You can tell by the color.
-这是名字 -你可以根据颜色辨别

233
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,334
It's a little confusing.
这有点混乱

234
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:49,390
But, the property is called Customer, and the type is called Customer.
但是，该属性称为 Customer ，类型称为 Customer

235
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:59,822
And, this is going to need that database context,so we are going to make a little Database here.
而且，这将需要数据库上下文，所以我们将在这里制作一个小数据库

236
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:03,982
And this is just being the voice of the person doing this at home.
而这正是在家里做这件事的人的声音

237
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:07,725
Why have you made it private read only?
为什么你只让它成为私人阅读？

238
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:09,934
So that's a great point.
这是一个很好的观点

239
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:16,782
I don't want people who get a hold of create model to be poking around and talking directly to the database.
我不想让那些持有创建模型的人四处乱转，直接与数据库对话

240
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:21,774
So, it's gonna be private, just for me where me is CreateModel.
所以，它将是私人的，就我而言，我就是CreateModel

241
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:27,790
And it's read only which means I'm gonna assign it once, and I don't want anyone to touch it after that.
它是只读的，这意味着我要把它分配一次，我不想让任何人在那之后接触它

242
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,590
-Yeah. Okay -So I'm making it just for me and making sure I can't mess with it afterwards.
-Yeah. Okay -所以我只是为我做，确保我以后不会弄乱它

243
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,894
Excellent, excellent question.
确实是个好问题

244
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:41,934
-So then, we'll make our -CreateModel Our constructor.
-那么，我们将制造 -CreateModel 我们的构造器

245
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:46,350
And remember how dependency injection works.
还记住依赖注入是如何工作的

246
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,422
We don't make an AppDbContext we ask for one.
我们不要求一个 AppDB 上下文

247
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:55,054
We ask for it by putting it in our constructor.
我们把它放在我们的构造函数中

248
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:58,638
We can have as many of these as we want,We can have food and bar, etc, etc, etc.
我们可以有很多我们想要的，我们可以有食物和酒吧等等

249
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,366
This is the one we want for now.
这就是我们现在想要的

250
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:06,391
And then I'm just going to say hey, this one equals this one.
然后我要说，嘿，这个等于这个

251
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:09,655
I'm going to squirrel it away and hang onto it, so now I've got one.
我要松开它然后挂上它，所以现在我有一个

252
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,425
So that says there's this database, and I want to know about it.
所以说有这个数据库，我想知道

253
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,206
This says there's a customer.
这说明有一个 customer

254
00:16:20,206 --> 00:16:29,934
If I go back over to create, I can hover over that and see it's getting me probably IntelliSense too.
如果我回去创造，我可以在上面徘徊，看到它也让我很有智慧

255
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:31,662
Yep, see. Now, it is.
是的，明白了。现在，它是的

256
00:16:31,662 --> 00:16:36,654
So, it knows about customer because it's hanging off of the model.
所以，它知道客户是因为它脱离了模型

257
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,110
So as we're running the application.
所以我们正在运行应用程序

258
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,486
Technically, I should be able to go to this page,hover over customer name and see what names we've put in there?
从技术上讲，我应该能够到这个页面，悬停在客户的名字上，看看我们放在那里的名字？

259
00:16:45,486 --> 00:16:48,942
You should be able to click on that,you should be able to have IntelliSense.
你应该能够点击它，你应该能够拥有智能感知

260
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:54,958
If you did a break point,you should be able to stop in here at some point and look at that, and we'll do that in a little bit.
如果你做了一个突破点，你应该能够在这里停留在某个点，看看，我们会做一点点

261
00:16:55,675 --> 00:17:01,422
What we need, though, is we need to bind this form.
我们需要的是，我们需要约束这种形式

262
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:04,686
We're saying this input for customer name.
我们说的是客户姓名的输入

263
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:10,830
When I hit submit, we need to catch it on the server side.
当我点击提交时，我们需要在服务器端捕获它

264
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,070
I call it surviving the journey.
我称之为旅途中的幸存

265
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,414
Okay. Yeah, it's a good point.

It does need to survive the journey.

267
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,038
So I'm gonna get rid of this OnGet here.
所以我要把这件东西扔掉

268
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:18,574
So we're gonna do a post.

269
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,902
You can say OnPost.

270
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:26,550
You could do it like this but the right way to do it is like this.
你可以这样做，但是正确的方法就是这样

271
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:36,238
-Async? -Async, which means don't block, and we're gonna have a task that returns some action.
-异步？ -异步，这意味着不阻塞，我们将有一个任务返回一些动作

272
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:41,806
We might be doing something after this and I'm gonna say on OnPostAsync.
我们可能在这之后做点什么，我会在事后说

273
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,885
And it's giving me a little complaint here saying!
它给我一个小小的抱怨！

274
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:53,789
You didn't do a wait and you haven't returned a value.
你没有等待，你还没有返回数值

275
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:59,805
Code paths, not all code paths return a value.
代码路径，并非所有代码路径返回值

276
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:01,405
That's cuz we haven't done anything yet.
这是因为我们还没有做任何事情

277
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:08,125
So, when someone posts back, they hit submit,and it posts back to here.
所以，当有人发布帖子时，他们会点击提交，然后返回到这里

278
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:11,350
We would really like customer to have stuff in it.
我们真的希望客户有东西在里面

279
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,845
-Yes -And so there's a couple things here.
-是的 -所以这里有两件事

280
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:18,975
And then we need to make sure that the state of that model is valid, that someone hasn't messed with it.
然后我们需要确保那个模型的状态是有效的，有人没有弄错它

281
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:30,280
So I'm gonna say if ModelState.IsValid,or if it's not, pardon me- I was about to say something.
所以我要说，如果MealStal.是有效的，或者如果不是，请原谅我——我要说点什么

282
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:36,168
No I appreciate that,Then return the page back to itself to say now I'm done.
不，我很感激，然后把页面还给自己，说现在我完了
283
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:43,016
If I hover over page you can see it returns a page result,which is a kind of action.
如果我在页面上徘徊，你会看到它返回一个页面结果，这是一种行为

284
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:44,600

00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:58,440
It is a applicationDB context.
它是 AppultDB 上下文

288
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,832
In there is customers, plural.
里面有 customers ，复数

00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:04,072
-And we want to add one. -.Add()

291
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,160
And then we'll say, hang out for a minute, await.

我们会说, db.SaveChanges,async 意味着不需要等待

Yeah, so you're doing a redirect?

296
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,976
We're gonna do a redirect, exactly.

297
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:35,950
And we haven't got a place to go yet,But we'll say redirect to page
我们还没有地方可去，但是我们会说重定向到页面

298
00:19:36,264 --> 00:19:41,675
Okay. And you can see that there's options like redirect to page permanent, which would be a 301.
可以。你可以看到有重定向到页面永久性的选项，这将是301

299
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:43,437
-Okay -Http 301
-Okay -HTTP 301

300
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:48,875

我们要做一个302，因为这只是一种标准的重定向

301
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:52,988
And I think we should probably just say /,but we'll see what happens.
我想我们应该说/，我想我们应该说一下，但是我们看看会发生什么

302
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:56,999
If people wanted to learn more about 301s,302s, do you have any recommendations?
如果人们想了解更多关于301S、302S的信息，你有什么建议吗？

304
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,479
I would search around for that kind of stuff.

305
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:03,143
Ultimately look at the docs.
最后看看文档

306

-Yeah -But redirect to page is a standard thing and again if you hover over it, it says right there Status302Found.
-是的 -但是重定向到PAGE是一个标准的事情，如果你在它上面徘徊，它会在那里找到STATES302

We would change it?

309
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:25,927
Change it to a 301, which would tell the search engine,don't ever come back here and ask me about this again.
将它改为301，这将告诉搜索引擎，不要再回来这里问我这个问题了

310
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:28,423
Don't ever talk to me again go here.
不说了，继续吧

-All right -That's what that means

00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:35,137
I'm paranoid so anyway,you never wanna do that when you're doing database work.
我是偏执狂，无论如何，当你做数据库工作的时候，你从来都不想这么做

You always wanna be temporary, okay?

Okay. All right, and if you really,really, really wanna upset your coworkers.

316
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

317

And do stuff like this.

But you might have other stuff that you wanna do.

-For me- Does it bother you?

323
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,731
I kinda like it on one line if it's not that big of a deal.
我喜欢它在一行如果它不是那么大的交易

324
00:21:14,425 --> 00:21:20,003
You know what I mean,but as soon as you have an extra line then you're gonna go and undo it and take it apart.
你知道我的意思,但是一旦你有一个额外的线，那么你会去解开它，并把它拆开

325
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:24,227
It's stylistic,so it's not really a best practice for someone to know of right now.
它是风格化的，所以对于现在知道的人来说这不是最好的练习

326
00:21:24,675 --> 00:21:28,579
No, for right now, I just think it's nice to have everything fit on one line like that.

That's a best practice.
这是最好的做法

330
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:43,059
It still gets us, that when people say curly braces, and I don't know what they're talking about
当人们说花括号，我不知道他们在说什么的时候，我们还是用括号

331
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:43,750
-What do you call them? -cuz I use brackets

There is your name=Customer.Name.

And it generated an id for us as well.

But you can see that nothing's happening.

对客户来说，实际上我想把一个突破点提高一点，然后我会向你解释发生了什么

Let's see if we can even get to the post.

361
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:40,556
Okay, do a debug session again /create.
好，再试一次调试/创建

362
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:49,414
So I would've expected.
所以我早就料到了

363
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,606
-To hit that break point -To hit that break point, so that's concerning.
-击中那个断点 -击中那个断点，这就是问题所在

364

But I know that I need to say BindProperty on the customer which is to tell it I want this customer object filled out with the form information, right?
但我知道我需要对客户说BDIN属性，告诉客户我希望这个客户对象填写表单信息，对吧？

So let's take a look, and try this again.

客户将被创建并填写与这些字段绑定的信息

368

如果这不起作用，那么我就忘记了什么，我们会去做一个小调试，这将是有趣的

他们说精神错乱的定义是一遍又一遍地做同样的事情，期望得到不同的结果

让我们来看一看

371
00:24:54,352 --> 00:24:56,272
It's probably something obvious.
这可能是显而易见的事情

372
00:24:59,408 --> 00:25:03,625
So we've got a form, we've got our input, we've got our method.
所以我们有一张表格，我们有我们的输入，我们有我们的方法

373
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:06,704
I said post, does it matter if it's all caps?
我说，如果所有的帽子都有关系吗？

374
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:09,328
That would be odd if it did.
如果真是这样，那就太奇怪了

375
00:25:14,384 --> 00:25:15,792
So it doesn't matter.
所以没关系

376
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:23,920
The tag helper exists already in view imports,the form is there.
标签助手已经存在于视图导入中，表单就在那里

377
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,272

我唯一没有添加的是验证摘要，好吗？

378
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:44,719

-Okay -好吧，所以我要穿一个长长的名字，华丽的裤子，什么也没发生

379
00:25:44,783 --> 00:25:57,625
-No -No, and am realizing that I've got my form with my input for customer name,but I put my validation summary outside the form.
-不 -不，我意识到我已经有了我的客户姓名输入表格，但是我把我的验证总结放在表格之外

380
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:02,553
-Okay -So I am gonna put it inside the form,cuz it's validating the form.
-好的 -所以我会把它放在表单里面，因为它正在验证表单

381
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:15,519
And then I'm gonna hit Refresh, Fancy Pants, see and it says the Field Name, must be a string with maximum length of 10.
然后我要刷新，华丽的裤子，看到它说的是字段名称，必须是一个最大长度为10的字符串

I'm getting that validation for free, right?
我免费得到验证，对吧？

383
00:26:20,383 --> 00:26:22,111
And where did that 10 come from?

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,871
We set it in, yep, right there.

385
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:29,279
We set it right there.
我们把它放在那里

386
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,695
So maybe we'll change that to like 25, or something like that.
也许我们会把它变成25，或者类似的东西

387
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:38,495
Some people have really long names like in my country who have names which are 50, so maybe 100?
有些人在我的国家有很长的名字，名字有50个，也许是100个？

388
00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:40,991
I'll make 49 and then that one 50 person,they're gonna suffer.
我要49，然后50个人，他们会受罪

389
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,000
-Man -inclusion. But the point is it's driven by
-人 -包括。但关键是它是由它们驱动的

390
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:46,623
-By them -By them, okay?
-通过他们 -通过他们, 好吗?

391
00:26:46,623 --> 00:26:52,959
And then one other thing- So it'd be the same if someone did entered something that wasn't an email, right?
-还有一件事 -如果有人输入了不是电子邮件的东西，情况也会一样，对吧？

392
00:26:52,959 --> 00:27:01,279
Yeah, it could be an email, it could be,you can put in validation information however you want,and you could even put in custom, regular expressions, or even write your own custom validators.
是的，它可以是电子邮件，它可以是，你可以放入验证信息，不管你想要什么，你甚至可以放入自定义，正则表达式，甚至写自己的自定义验证器

393
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,751
So they could be as sophisticated as you want.
所以他们可以像你想要的那样复杂

394
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:09,215
-Okay -You could also, I believe, say, I want a span.
-好吧 -你也可以说，我想要一个跨距

395
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:18,303
And say asp-validation-for, and you could go and do a field by field validation, okay.
并用ASP验证，你可以去做一个实地验证，好吧

396
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:26,303
So here I'm saying this is my summary of all the different things, this is a specific validation for Customer Name.
所以我说这是我对所有不同事物的总结，这是对客户名称的具体验证

397
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:36,725
Okay, let's see what that looks like And that might look a little different so if I come over here, come back over here and hit Refresh,oops I actually don't hit Refresh.
好吧，让我们看看这是什么样子，这可能看起来有点不同，所以如果我来到这里，回到这里，点击刷新，OOP，我实际上不刷新

398
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:38,700
I need to run my app again cuz I stopped it.
我需要再次运行我的应用程序，因为我停止了它

399
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:40,835
Okay.
Okay

400
00:27:43,907 --> 00:27:45,059
Run that again.
再跑一遍

401
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:48,899
Go to Create.
去创建

402
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:52,611
I think we made it really long this time, right?
我想这次视频我们做的真的很长，对吧？（您二位还知道呀，累死我啦~）

403
00:27:54,723 --> 00:27:59,651
And I tab away and it says it must be a string with a maximum length of 49.
我把它拿走，它说它必须是一个最大长度为49的绳子

404
00:28:00,227 --> 00:28:00,675
Okay.
Okay

405
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:07,011
But I like the main validation stuff so we'll leave that like that, okay?
但是我喜欢主要的验证，所以我们就这样离开，好吗？

406
00:28:07,971 --> 00:28:18,723
Now, let's go back to our break points and run our debugger this time, and see if we can see the customer get found.
现在，让我们回到我们的断点，并运行我们的调试器这次，看看我们是否可以看到客户找到

407
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:19,491
Okay.
Okay

408
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:29,411
We had looked in the F12 developer tools before,we could see what's happening on the wire.
我们以前看过F12开发工具，我们可以看到电线上发生了什么

409
00:28:29,411 --> 00:28:33,315
This is a good way to kinda just see what's happening as you do your posts.
这是一个很好的方式，看看你做什么，当你做你的帖子

410
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:38,243
-So when you're looking, so you went to Developer Tools -Yeah. And the network?
-所以当你在看的时候，你就去开发工具了 -是啊。网络呢？

411
00:28:38,243 --> 00:28:40,099
I went to dot dot dot Developer Tools and we're under Network.
我想用 dot 开发工具，在网络下

412
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:48,900
Okay. I will go and probably and clear it out, and then we'll put in Maria, okay.
可以。我会去把它弄清楚，然后我们就去Maria，好吗？

413
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,411
Yep, there we go, so if you hover over that.
是的，我们走了，所以如果你悬停在上面

414
00:28:53,475 --> 00:29:02,051
If we hover over Customer, see,because customer has a name.
如果我们悬停在客户身上，请看，因为客户有名字

415
00:29:02,051 --> 00:29:08,963
Yeah. Customer.name, and we name the field Customer.name, and we told it, hey,bind, we want you to participate.
是啊。客户。名称，我们命名字段客户。名称，我们告诉它，嘿，BIN，我们希望你参与

416
00:29:10,075 --> 00:29:12,775
You automatically showed up in there.
你会自动出现在那里

417
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:15,043
-Okay -And I can put a little pin there as well
-Okay -我也可以放一个小别针

418
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:23,171
If I was gonna do lots of debugging sessions,then I can keep you there as a post to note and watch customer name change over time.
如果我要做很多调试会话，那么我可以把你放在那里作为一个帖子来记录和观察客户名称的变化

419
00:29:23,171 --> 00:29:28,400
-That's a good one -We can go and see if the model state is valid, it is.
-那是一个不错的选择 -我们可以去看看模型状态是否有效

420
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:33,790
-What is the green button, that's a play like -Yeah, go to that point.
-什么是绿色按钮，这是一个游戏 -是的，到那一点

421
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,959
Play up to that point, and then stop.
玩到那一点，然后停下来

422
00:29:39,025 --> 00:29:42,574
So here, I'm gonna go and Add that customer to the database.
所以，我要把这个客户添加到数据库中

423
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:45,646
Save it to the database,which of course is an in-memory database.
将其保存到数据库中，这当然是内存数据库

424
00:29:45,646 --> 00:29:52,401
And then we'll redirect Now we had put in slash, but I'm not sure that's gonna work.
嗯，然后我们重定向，现在我们已经投入了斜杠，但我不确定这会起作用

425
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:55,473
Should we should we see about their pages, just in case?
我们应该看看他们的网页，以防万一吗？

426
00:29:55,473 --> 00:29:56,325
-Yeah, see? -Okay.
-是的，看到了吗？ -Okay

427
00:29:56,325 --> 00:30:00,677
It's says no page / matches this value.
它没有页面/匹配这个值

428
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:02,252
So you have to give the specific name

429
00:30:02,252 --> 00:30:08,798
I need to say index, which was what our main page is here
我需要 index ，在这里这是我们的主页

430
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:10,654
So index, okay?
So index, okay?

431
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:13,662
Now we'll confirm if that that works.
现在我们确认这是否可行

432
00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:22,366
I can hit F5 to go and debug, or I can hit Ctrl+F5,which I like to do, cuz it starts up a little faster,if I know that I'm not gonna do a debugging session.
我可以命中F5去调试，或者我可以点击CTRL+F5，我喜欢这样做，因为它启动得快一点，如果我知道我不会做调试会话

433
00:30:23,774 --> 00:30:25,118
But this time you hit F5?
但这次你击中了F5？

434
00:30:25,118 --> 00:30:27,102
I hit Ctrl+F5 to go faster.
我点击Ctrl +F5以加快速度

435
00:30:28,382 --> 00:30:33,566
Okay, so it redirected me to index but of course I haven't done anything on index that's interesting yet.
好的，它让我重定向到索引，当然我还没有做任何有意思的索引

436
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,294
That will be the next part, right.
这将是下一个部分，对

437
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:38,700
So you could also probably send a message saying
所以你也可以发送一个信息说

438
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,670
I can say customer updated,or whatever.
我可以说客户更新，或者什么

439
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:43,486
But let's rip out this whole section here.
但是让我们把整个部分撕掉

440
00:30:43,486 --> 00:30:46,046
-Okay, very nice -And put a list of contents.
-Okay ，非常好 -并列一个目录


441
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:47,326
-Okay -Is that cool?
-Okay -酷吗？

442
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:50,782
So where's our index?
那么我们的索引在哪里呢？

443
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,558
So this is all this carousel and all this stuff.
这就是所有的旋转木马和所有这些东西

444
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:55,902
All the fancy bootstrap.
所有的花样引导

445
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:58,910
I'm gonna actually collect this.
我要收集这个

446
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,446
And then you comment it out?
然后你评论一下？

447
00:31:00,446 --> 00:31:04,030
Actually, no, I'm just gonna be awesome and just like toss it.
事实上，不会的，我会就像扔硬币一样棒棒

448
00:31:04,094 --> 00:31:12,800
Wow. Yeah, but this is a way,if you wanna go hunting for the other side of the div,you can just fold these up, see that this matches this.
真的。是的，但是这是一种方式，如果你想去寻找另一个DIV，你可以把它们折叠起来，看看这与这个匹配

449
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:17,545
Fold it up, select over it and toss it.
把它折叠起来，选择它并扔它

450
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:22,537
Cool, all right.
酷，好吧

451
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:24,905
So let's make our form.
所以，让我们形成自己的形式

452
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:31,433
And this will be on the index page, right?
这将在索引页上，对吗？

453
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:37,425
We'll have method="post", and this will be a table.
是的。我们将有方法=“POST”，这将是一个表

454
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,564
All right.
好的

455
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,721
It's okay to use tables, if it is a table of data.
如果表是数据表，可以使用表

456
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:47,650
So many people complain about tables being a bad idea.
很多人抱怨表是个坏主意

457
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,825
I think that's kind of funny,It's a table,It's okay to have a table.
我觉得这很有趣，这是一张表，有一张表是可以的

458
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:56,192
So we'll have a head for our table, and we'll have our ID row.
所以我们有一张表，我们会有 ID 行

459
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:08,096
-Yep -Oops, and we'll have ID.
-Yep -哎呀，我们会有 ID 的

460
00:32:09,632 --> 00:32:14,675
Then we'll have Name, we don't really need to show the database ID but for now let's show it.
然后我们将有名字，我们不需要显示数据库ID，但是现在让我们来展示它

461
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:19,950
All right,So do you have to create a tbody, okay yeah,you're way ahead of me.
所以你必须创建一个 tbody ，好吧，是的，你在我前面

462
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,048
No, it's okay. Table body
不，没关系 Table body

463
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:26,080
But now I need a row for each.
但现在我需要每一行

464
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:33,900
So would you put it in the row, or would you,so I am presumed that you need to go for every contact within.
所以你会把它放在队列中，还是你，所以我推测你需要去寻找里面的每一个联系人

465
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,555
Exactly.
确切地

466
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:40,352
So I'm gonna have like a FOR SOMETHING HERE.
所以我会有类似于 FOR SOMETHING HERE 的东西

467
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:53,675
Then a couple of cells, table cells, and then maybe a, I don't know,like a link to edit and a delete button.
然后是两个单元格，表格单元格，也许是A，我不知道，像一个编辑和删除按钮的链接

468
00:32:53,675 --> 00:32:54,507
Yeah.
Yeah.

469
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,952
-Okay, you see how I'm kind of sketching it out -You're sketching it out
-好吧，你看我是怎么画出来的 -你正在描绘它

470
00:32:57,952 --> 00:32:59,448
-Okay. Wild -what's it called?
-Okay. 野生 -它叫什么？

471
00:32:59,448 --> 00:33:02,925
-Pseudocode or something? -Pseudocode,It's a little pseudocode here
-Pseudocode 或者 something? -Pseudocode ,这里有点伪代码

472
00:33:02,925 --> 00:33:04,050
So now I wanna say at.
所以现在我想说

473
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:08,100
For each yeah. And this is a snippet-
对每个人来说是的。这是一个片段

474
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:20,096
-Yeah -Tab, Tab, and then I'm gonna say for each,contact, oops, contact in, in what?
-Yeah -Tab, Tab, 然后我会说，每个人，联系，OOP，联系进来，在什么？

475
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:21,056
In Model.
在模型中

476
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,232
Now where is our customers?
现在我们的客户在哪里？

477
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:31,104
Okay, so remember before when we were doing our create model?
好的，所以记得在我们做我们的创建模型之前吗？

478
00:33:31,104 --> 00:33:34,752
We needed to have the customers come from somewhere.
我们需要让顾客从某个地方来

479
00:33:34,752 --> 00:33:36,352
Yeah. Now we're in a totally different page.
是啊。现在我们完全不一样了

480
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:38,100
Yeah, so we have to have the customers.
是的，所以我们必须有顾客

481
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,125
We have to have the customers, right?
我们必须有客户，对吧？

482
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:41,075
Yeah. So I'm gonna just take a break here.
是啊。所以我要在这里休息一下

483
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:49,472
And I'm gonna jump over to the index model cuz we can't really make our table till we have a little bit more, okay?
我要跳到 index 模型，因为我们不能真的做我们的表，直到我们有多一点，好吗？

484
00:33:49,536 --> 00:33:59,520
And I'm gonna break a couple of cardinal rules that I'm gonna copy paste a little code,because I'm gonna need this similar app database.
我要打破一些基本规则，我要复制粘贴一个小代码，因为我需要这个类似的应用程序数据库

485
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,656
This app db context which is gonna save myself a moment of time here.
这个App DB上下文将在这里节省我自己的时间

486
00:34:04,064 --> 00:34:08,736
So we've got our app context, right?
所以我们有了应用程序上下文，对吧？

487
00:34:08,736 --> 00:34:10,976
We're gonna have our index page model.
我们将有索引页模型

488
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,904
Now before, when we create a customer,we create one customer.
现在，当我们创建一个客户时，我们创建了一个客户

489
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:24,416
But here our model is different cuz we're gonna have a list of customers on this page, right?
但在这里我们的模型不同，因为我们会在这一页上有一个客户列表，对吧？

490
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:25,504
So our model is different.
所以我们的模型是不同的

491
00:34:25,952 --> 00:34:31,136
And we'll do a get and then a private set so that only we can set it.
我们会做一个GET，然后是一个私有集合，这样我们才可以设置它

492
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:40,736
-All right, and then, in the OnGet, We'll say OnGet -One line below, OnGetAsync, okay
-好的,然后在 OnGet 我们会在 OnGet -One 下面一行, OnGetAsync, okay

493
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:48,480
-OnGetAsync, right? -We're gonna load up customers.
-OnGetAsync, 是吗? -我们要去接客户

494
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,568
Where do we get them from?
我们从哪里得到它们？

495
00:34:50,075 --> 00:34:51,168
The database and this is right there.
数据库就在这里

496
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,525
We're getting them out of customers.
我们把他们从客户那里弄出来

497
00:34:54,525 --> 00:35:01,400
And then there's this other little bit of thing that you can add on to make things a little bit faster.
还有另外一点你可以补充的东西让事情稍微快一点

498
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,875
You can say AsNoTracking.
你可以 AsNoTracking.

499
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:11,496
And I'll show you what that means in a second.
我会告诉你这意味着什么

500
00:35:11,496 --> 00:35:16,609
And we're gonna turn these customers into a list of customers.
我们会把这些客户变成客户名单

501
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:19,808
So we're chaining things together,we're saying give me these customers.
所以我们把事情联系在一起，我们是说给我这些客户

502
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:24,032
And we're not gonna keep track of them changing.
我们不会跟踪他们的变化

503
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:28,960
You see it says disabling change tracking is useful for read-only scenarios.
您可以看到禁用更改跟踪对于只读场景是有用的

504
00:35:29,975 --> 00:35:37,400
Change tracking is watching like keeping a track of all the different things you could change so that you know how to make a database update.
就像跟踪所有你可以改变的事物的轨迹，这样你就知道如何进行数据库更新

505
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:53,575
So if I had a list of customers, and I wanted to watch all of them and change their names, that would give the database system entity framework that we're gonna learn about later all the information it needs about how to only change the bits that change, how to only change the database.
所以，如果我有一个客户列表，我想看所有的人，并改变他们的名字，这将给出数据库系统实体框架，我们稍后将了解所有关于如何只更改这些位的信息，如何只更改数据库

506
00:35:53,575 --> 00:35:58,976
But we're just getting a list, so we're gonna say, don't track these, just give me a list.
但我们只是得到一个列表，所以我们要说，不要跟踪这些，只要给我一个清单

507
00:35:58,976 --> 00:36:03,712
So customers, no tracking, give me a list, so that's cool.
所以客户，没有跟踪，给我一个清单，所以很酷

508
00:36:04,928 --> 00:36:07,424
And I think we'll leave that like that for now.
我想我们现在就这样离开

509
00:36:07,744 --> 00:36:09,984
We'll go back over to index.
我们将回到 index

510
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:17,591
And now that model, the page behind us has customers.
现在这个模型，我们后面的页面有客户

511
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:20,840
Look, customers shows up, see, which is nice.
看，顾客出现了，看，哪一个很好

512
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,950
So then I think I can put my tr in here.
所以我想我可以把我的 tr 放在这里

513
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,120
And I'm hoping, remember, I said contact, I should say customer.
我希望，记住，我说联系，我应该说客户

514
00:36:31,848 --> 00:36:43,944
Customer singular, foreach customer,that means that the customer variable is now available to me customer.Id.
客户单数，前额客户，这意味着客户变量现在可以给我客户

515
00:36:46,025 --> 00:36:50,152
-Everything's connected -Yep, cool, let's try that.
-一切都是相连的 -酷，让我们试试看.

516
00:36:50,152 --> 00:36:53,550
Okay. And then we'll do the rest,cuz I don't know if this is gonna work yet.
然后我们做剩下的事情，因为我不知道这是否可行

517
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:59,496
Now I'm using an in-memory database, so every time I run this, it's gonna go away.
现在我使用的是内存数据库，所以每次运行这个数据库，它都会消失

518
00:36:59,496 --> 00:37:01,352
So it's just a throw away database.
所以这是一个一次性数据库

519
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:10,440
-I need to do better -I need to maybe make tests later, and I survived the journey.
-我需要做得更好 -我需要以后再做测试，我在旅途中幸存下来

520
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:16,000
-You did -Let's see, but as soon as I shut you down, it's gonna be gone.
-你需要这么做 -让我看看，但是一旦我把你关了，它就不见了

521
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,784
-So if you refresh the page -You're here,you're still there, right?
-如果你刷新页面 -你在这里，你还在那里，对吧？

522
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:22,920
You're there until I close it, until I close this browser.
你在那里直到我关闭它，直到我关闭这个浏览器

523
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:27,464
Or not if I close the browser, pardon me,until I stop the web server.
或者，如果我关闭浏览器，请原谅我，直到我停止Web服务器

524
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:33,032
-So, okay -Yeah, thanks, cool, so now we've got create.
-好了 -谢谢，很酷，所以现在我们有了创建功能

525
00:37:33,825 --> 00:37:36,680
We should probably put a button down there at the bottom somewhere.
我们应该把按钮放在下面的某个地方

526
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:49,224
We've got some validation, we've got our database,looking at our friends And this is doing a thing called Post Redirect Get.
我们有一些验证，我们有我们的数据库，看我们的朋友，这是做一个叫做邮政重定向的东西

527
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:54,792
So I'm here, I hit a post, we do a redirect, and then we do a get, and then we would get this stuff here.
所以我在这里，我打了一个帖子，我们做了一个重定向，然后我们做了一个get，然后我们得到了这个东西

528
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,800
So this is a PRG, Post Redirect Get.
所以这是一个PRG，邮政重定向获得

529
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,424
There's lots of articles on the Internet about that.
网上有很多关于这方面的文章

530
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:05,608
Now let's make a link to theoretically go and edit these things.
现在让我们从理论上链接并编辑这些东西

531
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:08,050
-Okay -And then we'll have a button for Delete.
-Okay -然后我们有一个删除按钮

532
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,994
These things don't exist on the backend yet,but we can- So yeah,so we don't have an edit page yet.
这些东西在后端还不存在，但是我们可以——所以是的，所以我们还没有编辑页面

533
00:38:10,994 --> 00:38:13,089
-We don't -Okay. We can make a link
-我们没有 -可以。我们可以建立联系

534
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:14,753
Now I could go and put in a link, href.
现在我可以走了，把一个链接，HREF

535
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:16,825
You've done this before a million times.
你已经做过一百万次了

536
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:21,857
And say /edit and then put in strings and stuff.
然后说/编辑，然后把字符串和东西

537
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:24,289
But remember we talked about how great tag helpers are.
但是记住，我们谈到了标签助手的伟大之处

538
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:34,721
-Yeah -What if we went and said asp-page and then we could go and say there's an edit page and then it would figure out what the URL would look like.
-Yeah -如果我们去说ASP页面，然后我们可以说有一个编辑页面，然后它就会知道URL会是什么样子

539
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:41,450
-Okay -All right, and then it could even express the route a certain way.
-Okay -然后它甚至可以以某种方式表达路线

540
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,775
And we'll talk about routes in a minute.
我们将在一分钟内谈论路线

541
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,450
I think it's route-id.
我认为这是路由器ID

542
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,729
And I think we called it customer.Id.
我想我们命名为 customer.Id

543
00:38:53,729 --> 00:39:04,000
So it's gonna take that customer's id so we want to basically make a page that looks like /edit/2, /edit/3, right?
所以它将采取客户的ID，所以我们想基本上制作一个页面，看起来像/编辑/ 2，/编辑/ 3，对吗？

544
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:11,075
And that's the route id that's gonna get added onto that.
这就是将要添加到那个的路径ID

545
00:39:11,075 --> 00:39:13,761
Okay, so the next thing you have is a button?
好吧，那么接下来你有一个按钮？

546
00:39:13,761 --> 00:39:22,900
Yeah, we'll do a button type="submit" and this is going to be handled by the page.
是的，我们会做一个按钮类型=“提交”，这将由页面来处理

547
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,409
-Okay -Button's gonna be a little different.
-Okay -按钮会有点不同

548
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:31,937
The reason that we're doing a button in an href is so you can see the difference between a link,and how links behave, and buttons.
我们在HREF中做一个按钮的原因是，你可以看到一个链接和链接的行为和按钮之间的区别

549
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:34,177
A link is gonna navigate somewhere.
一个链接将导航到某处

550
00:39:34,177 --> 00:39:36,929
-Yep -And a button's gonna cause a post, right?
-Yep -一个按钮会引起一个帖子，对吧？

551
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:42,375
So this will go and be handled by the delete handler.
这将由删除处理程序处理

552
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:47,800
But we also need that route information, we need that id because we're gonna delete a particular customer.
但是我们也需要那个路线信息，我们需要那个ID，因为我们要删除一个特定的客户

553
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,009
-So you need the content ID, yep -Customer ID, exactly
-所以你需要内容ID，是吧 -确切地说是客户ID

554
00:39:52,275 --> 00:39:54,913
All right, and then none of this is hooked up.
好吧，然后这些都没有连接起来

555
00:39:54,977 --> 00:40:01,275
So you mentioned something, voice of the people at home,about the button being a post.
所以你提到了一些东西，家里人的声音，关于按钮的帖子

556
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:11,550
Yes, it is going to post back and then we're gonna need to handle that behavior differently than the Create page.
是的，它将发布回，然后我们需要处理不同于创建页面的行为

557
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,250
So then I'll just put a link at the bottom there for Create.
然后我会在底部放置一个链接来创建

558
00:40:13,975 --> 00:40:15,125
So I'm just gonna hit Refresh.
所以我只需要刷新一下

559
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:18,725
-So let's see if the Create -Here's our Create.
-我们看看是不是创造 -这是我们的创造

560
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,689
That still works.
这仍然有效

561
00:40:22,689 --> 00:40:25,825
-Okay -I hover over that.
-Okay -我犹豫了一下

562
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:28,625
Nothing's happening because we don't have an edit.
没有任何事情发生，因为我们没有编辑

563
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,505
We never made an edit page, and I hit Delete You should.
我们从来没有编辑页面，我点击删除你应该

564
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:38,400
It's gonna crash cuz it's like I don't know what you're doing, right?
它会崩溃，因为我不知道你在做什么，对吧？

565
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,125
It's just in the middle of something and it's confused cuz that's not what I asked it to do.
它只是在某个事物的中间，它很混乱，因为这不是我要它做的

566
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,225
Okay, so we've got some fixing up to do.
好的，所以我们有一些修复工作要做

567
00:40:46,225 --> 00:40:51,460
Let's try Delete first -Okay. All right, so let's go over here.
让我们先试着删除，好吧。好的，让我们过去

568
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:58,450
We made an OnGet -Let's go and make an OnDelete.
我们制作了一个 OnGET ，让我们去做一个 OnDelphi

569
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:08,932
-Okay -Same thing as before with an IActionResult, except now we're gonna say on and this is kinda weird, OnPostDelete.
-Okay -和以前一样，除了现在我们要说，这有点奇怪，OnPostDelete

570
00:41:09,764 --> 00:41:20,964
The verb delete is a real HTTP verb,but it's not really often used from a browser's perspective.
动词删除是一个真正的HTTP动词，但它实际上并不经常从浏览器的角度使用

571
00:41:20,964 --> 00:41:25,700
It's usually done as it's piggybacked on post.
它通常是背负在 post

572
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,732
We use post to pass in basically all kinds of information.
我们利用 post 基本上传递各种信息

573
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,980
Whenever we hit Submit on a form, we're posting that form.
每当我们在一个表单上点击提交时，我们就发布了这个表单

574
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,884
We're adding in, I think we said, page-handler delete.
我们添加，我想我们说，页面处理删除

575
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,492
So that is gonna be here, OnPostDelete.
那就在这里，OnPostDelete

576
00:41:44,388 --> 00:41:53,092
And now we're going to say,a customer, customer singular.
现在我们要说，客户，客户单一

577
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:56,484
And we'll go and get that customer out of the database.
我们去把客户从数据库中拿出来

578
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:04,600
Before we delete it we gotta go and get it to make sure it's there,I say find, by that ID that got passed in.
在删除之前，我们必须去拿它，确保它在那里，我说，找到，通过那个ID

579
00:42:05,709 --> 00:42:10,314
So now we gotta check to see if that customer's null or not, cuz if it's null, then we don't even bother.
所以现在我们必须检查这个客户是否为空，因为如果它是空的，那么我们甚至不用麻烦

580
00:42:10,634 --> 00:42:12,746
If it's not null, do something.
如果它不是空的，就做点什么

581
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,354
And then we can go and Redirect.
然后我们可以重定向

582
00:42:17,674 --> 00:42:18,442
To a page.
一页

583
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:20,362
To a page, exactly, thank you.
一页，确切地说，谢谢

584
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:24,138
So here, we're gonna remove it from the database.
所以，我们将从数据库中删除它

585
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:32,983
And we are doing it in a memory database but it doesn't matter because if it was a regular database it would remove it for us, as well, that's what's nice about any framework.
我们在内存数据库中做这件事，但这并不重要，因为如果它是一个常规数据库，它也会为我们移除它，这就是任何框架的好处

586
00:42:33,495 --> 00:42:34,775
I'm not a very good typer.
我不是一个很好的人

587
00:42:35,927 --> 00:42:43,543
So we remove the customer and then we go and we save those changes.
因此，我们删除客户，然后我们去，我们保存这些变化

588
00:42:46,935 --> 00:42:51,159
-Okay -And then I would expect it would then redirect to the page,the same page.
-Okay -然后我预计它会重定向到页面，同一个页面

589
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:56,598
Yes. And I would expect that it would disappear from that list because it's going to go back to the database and build the list again.
对。我希望它会从那个列表中消失，因为它将回到数据库并重新构建列表

590
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,646
-Does that make sense? -It does, it sure does.
-这有道理吗？ -是的，的确如此

591
00:42:59,646 --> 00:43:01,182
I think that's what it will do.
我想这就是它所要做的

592
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,022
So we cross our fingers and hope that it works.
所以我们交叉手指，希望它能起作用

593
00:43:07,646 --> 00:43:08,926
And if it doesn't, we learn.
如果没有，我们就学会了

594
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:15,291
-Okay -That's not a good name.
-Okay -那不是个好名字

595
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,050
All right, we're deleting you.
好吧，我们正在删除你

596
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,059
Okay, I'm fine with that.
好吧，我很好

597
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,536
-It does work the way you want -Yeah, it does work
-它可以按你想要的方式工作 -是的，它确实有效

598
00:43:27,536 --> 00:43:28,808
-Fire, fire, fire -Deal, deal, deal.
-火，火，火 -交易，交易，交易

599
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:32,700
-Fancy pants -But now if we edit it.
-花式裤子 -但现在如果我们编辑它

600
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,644
Doesn't work because Edit doesn't exist.
不起作用，因为编辑不存在

601
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:36,796
And it is not there.
它不在那里

602
00:43:36,796 --> 00:43:38,025
All right, so let's go and do edit, then.
好吧，那么我们去编辑一下吧

603
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,196
So we'll do what you said before, add razor page.
所以我们会做你之前说过的，添加 RaZor Page

604
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,800
Call it Edit, now I know you like routing.
称之为编辑，现在我知道你喜欢路由

605
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,604
Routing is one of your favorite things about ASP.NET.
路由是 ASP.NET 最喜欢的事情之一

606
00:43:52,604 --> 00:44:00,284
So this Edit page is gonna be the first time that we've ever had a page that took in information.
所以这个编辑页面将是我们第一次有一个信息页面

607
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:03,548
-Okay -Where does that go to pass in the ID?
-Okay -好吧，ID会在哪里通过？

608
00:44:04,124 --> 00:44:10,076
-So up there at page? -Right, quote quotes.
-在页面上吗？ -右，引号

609
00:44:10,076 --> 00:44:11,932
Yeah, and curly brackets.
是的，还有卷曲的括号

610
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,575
-Yeah -ID.
-是的 -ID

611
00:44:15,575 --> 00:44:16,919
I mean int.
我的意思是 INT

612
00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:19,378
Okay so the ID is of type int.
好的，ID 是 int 型的

613
00:44:19,378 --> 00:44:21,042
Yes. That's the type hint.
对。这就是类型提示

614
00:44:21,675 --> 00:44:25,030
So this is saying edit slash 3.
这就是编辑斜线 3

615
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,782
So you'd see it in the browser,that's what it would look like.
所以你会在浏览器中看到它，这就是它的样子

616
00:44:27,782 --> 00:44:28,425
Okay.
可以

617
00:44:28,742 --> 00:44:36,125
We have our Edit model, and then here, at the top, we might have Edit, we could actually add a little bit of text here.
我们有我们的编辑模型，然后在这里，在顶部，我们可能有编辑，我们实际上可以在这里添加一点文本

618
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:37,341
We could say Edit Customer.
我们可以说编辑客户

619
00:44:38,493 --> 00:44:41,373
And then we could say -Dash Model?
-然后我们可以说 -破折号模型？

620
00:44:41,373 --> 00:44:46,045
@Model.Customer, but again, we're not getting IntelliSense,why not?
@Model.Customer, 但是，我们没有得到智能感知，为什么不呢？

621
00:44:46,045 --> 00:44:49,693
Because the page model is different for each page.
因为页面模型对于每个页面都是不同的

622
00:44:49,693 --> 00:44:54,621
-Exactly -So let's go look at the one for Edit
-确切 -让我们看看编辑的那个

623
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:01,789
So I'm gonna.
所以我要去

624
00:45:01,789 --> 00:45:02,855
-You're gonna take, yeah -Borrow again
-你会接受的，是的 -再借钱

625
00:45:03,648 --> 00:45:13,440
Certainly I could make another class, a base class, that would pull that AppDBContext in so I wouldn't have to keep copy-pasting that because at some point the copy-pasting becomes tedious.
当然，我可以做另一个类，一个基类，它将拉那个AppDcRead，所以我不必保持复制粘贴，因为在某些时候，复制粘贴变得乏味

626
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:18,688
And you want to keep it dry, right.
你想保持干燥，对吧？

627
00:45:18,688 --> 00:45:20,224
Don't repeat yourself.
不要重复你自己

628
00:45:21,632 --> 00:45:24,125
You probably want that to survive the journey right?
你可能想让它在旅途中幸存？

629
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:24,925
Yeah.
是啊

630
00:45:24,925 --> 00:45:25,404
Okay.
Okay.

631
00:45:26,075 --> 00:45:31,168
So we want to survive the journey,with bindproperty, okay.
所以我们想在旅途中幸存下来

632
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:38,675
So I go back over to our page, and let's see if that worked.
所以我回到我们的页面，让我们看看这是否有效

633
00:45:39,552 --> 00:45:40,832
And it did, that's nice.

它不知道客户，因为我们有绑定，但我们从来没有加载客户

690
00:49:48,275 --> 00:50:02,475
So let's go and do our stuff again, we're gonna have our action result and here we're gonna say OnGet, of course,int id, that's gonna get passed in automatically because of the way we set up our routes, that's nice.
所以，让我们再去做我们的事情，我们将有我们的行动结果，在这里，我们要说OnGET，当然，INT ID，这将是通过自动的，因为我们设置我们的路线的方式，这是很好的
