1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:07,059
Hey friends, we're glad you're still with us here at Microsoft Virtual Academy as we do our intro to ASP.NET Core.

2
00:00:07,123 --> 00:00:08,595
We're learning all about razor pages and our application.

3
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:09,683
This module will be a little longer.

4
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,371
Yes it will.

5
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:15,571
And it will probably have us making some mistakes together,and that's okay.

6
00:00:15,635 --> 00:00:19,219
And we're gonna try not to hide anything from you.

7
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:24,339
We are following the documentation as we hope that are, and maybe you can follow along.

8
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:27,987
Pause, try stuff out, and maybe Google with Bing.

9
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:28,883
Google with Bing.

10
00:00:28,883 --> 00:00:30,547
If you have trouble and get stuck.

11
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:34,323
Yeah, and we will have links to the documentation right underneath this recording.

12
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:39,200
All right, so we're gonna try to make a CRUD page.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,000
What is CRUD?

14
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:45,777
Create,read, update, delete.

15
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:54,675
All right, so a CRUD application maps verbs from CRUD to verbs that we're used to using,like get is a get, so it would be like a read.

16
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:57,358
And if you're gonna create something, it would be a post.

17
00:00:57,358 --> 00:01:06,126
So you'd fill out a form, you'd hit submit, and it would post the data, that's a create Then you can maybe read it back and look at in edit page or then maybe delete it.

18
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:12,718
So if we succeed, we'll have the simple form,maybe create some customers, put them in a fake database And we'll be okay

19
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:16,878
Yeah, and I will be learning more about databases in the intermediate course as well 

20
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:18,606
Yes,well like a whole section on databases.

21
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:20,846
So for now, we're gonna be doing it in an in-memory database.

22
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:23,598
Okay, so let's do the best we can.

23
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:26,862
We're gonna use the same web application one that we created before.

24
00:01:26,862 --> 00:01:36,206
We saw in the previous modules where we added MVC, but of course all of that stuff was added for us because we went File > New Project,and we picked Web Application, all right?

25
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:44,782
So here in configure services, we've got AddMvc.

26
00:01:44,782 --> 00:01:48,430
But we're gonna make our little in-memory database here.

27
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:53,358
We're gonna say services.AddDbContext<>

28
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:55,150
Yeah, and give it name

29
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,030
And we gonna create a thing called AppDbContext.

30
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,630
We can name it whatever we want to.

31
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,638
We haven't written this yet, but we will.

32
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:05,902
I'm gonna hit Ctrl+dot.

33
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:10,382
And it's saying, hey, do you need an AppDbContext?

34
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:12,878
Do you wanna go and generate one of those?

35
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:14,670
I wanna go ahead and say yes.

36
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,190
So it's gone and done that, and we'll deal with that in a minute.

37
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,414
And again, I will very likely make mistakes, so you'll bear with me I hope.

38
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:27,214
I opened up the parentheses there.

39
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,942
And I'm gonna pass in some options.

40
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:35,470
- And the option I'm gonna pass in for my database context are options -UseInmemory.

41
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,966
-Use -In.

42
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,270
MemoryDatabase.

43
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:43,406
Yes, but the reason why that's not showing,that perfect.

44
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:44,942
-We need to add -why is that not showing up?

45
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:47,806
So we need to add the entity framework.

46
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:49,150
So we need to use

47
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,006
And I probably should have added that first, and

48
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:52,158
I would have gotten IntelliSense.

49
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:53,758
-True -Let's try that.

50
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:56,254
If we go back up to the top.

51
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,590
So we add the EntityFrameworkCore beforehand.

52
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:11,614
Look, you see that little arrow there that's pointing down?

53
00:03:11,614 --> 00:03:19,166
That means that this method came in was included by the fact that we just did that UseIn.

54
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,918
That's called an extension method.

55
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:23,070
It's along for the ride.

56
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,734
And you see it actually says extension.

57
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:26,334
That wasn't there seconds ago.

58
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:27,614
No, it wasn't.

59
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:37,406
Add InMemoryDatabase, some name All right,And then we look at the squiggle and we worry.

60
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:39,582
Does the squiggle mean something?

61
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:43,550
So, here it's saying AddDbContext.

62
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,598
Well, we never really went and did anything with that AddDbContext.

63
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:46,750
Let's go over there and fix that.

64
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,158
I'm gonna right click and say go to definition.

65
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,294
And let's work on our database context.

66
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:55,134
This is kind of standard stuff, so don't worry about it too much.

67
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,206
But basically this is representing the database.

68
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:01,278
I'm hitting Ctrl+dot there.

69
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:04,542
And I'll say make it an AppDbContext,

70
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:09,406
this is an constructor, all right?

71
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:14,078
Okay, and we're gonna take in some options.

72
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,686
ContextOptions.

73
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,438
-Oops, optoons -Options.

74
00:04:21,438 --> 00:04:24,126
Options, pass up to the base class those options.

75
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:25,534
I'm gonna put that.

76
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:33,150
What I'm trying to zoom and make it helpful for you, I end up making it worse for myself.

77
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:36,990
Well, at least you have other people in mind.

78
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:41,278
-I do. And then -You have to set it of some sort.

79
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:45,054
We have a set of, we're gonna say customers?

80
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,684
So we have a set of customer.

81
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:47,900
Customer does not exist here.

82
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,576
That's why it's squiggled out.

83
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:54,393
And then we do a getter, setter, get ; set, okay?

84
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:56,248
Customer is squiggled out.

85
00:04:56,248 --> 00:04:59,192
The type or namespace 'Customer' could not be found.

86
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:01,560
Well, that's true cuz we haven't made one yet.

87
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:02,648
We had not made it up.

88
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:06,424
l could type control dot, but l am gonna click show potential fixes.

89
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:08,664
This is kind of interesting.

90
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:11,224
Here it's saying, well, I can go and make customer for you.

91
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:12,696
But look at this here.

92
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:18,392
It's suggesting other packages that have the word customer and the name customer in it.

93
00:05:18,392 --> 00:05:21,784
So these are other NuGet packages,packages up in the world.

94
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:22,744
Yeah, ain't that cool?

95
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:23,448
That's very cool.

96
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,275
-Package out there that has the word customer in it -Has the word customer in it

97
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,102
No, I don't want those.

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:37,464
But if I was doing something with JSON or doing something with some technology that I knew I will need the NuGet packages, later it will go get it for me.

99
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:40,792
So I'm gonna say generate in new file, that seems reasonable.

100
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:43,800
-It does -All right, this generated that.

101
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,528
Now notice it just appeared.

102
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:52,225
-There it is -And now I'm gonna right click and say go to definition

103
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:56,975
It is worth pointing out that I could also right click and say Peak Definition.

104
00:05:56,975 --> 00:06:00,130
-And could you write in there? -I could.

105
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,225
I think that would be a little weird.

106
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:10,300
But then I can click on this little tab right here Promote to Document, and now I've jumped into that document.

107
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:16,175
So I can peek and then if I type a little bit,I was like this is tiresome, then I could jump even higher.

108
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,757
-That's pretty smooth. -It is pretty smooth.

109
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:21,405
-All right, I'll show you another smooth tip. -I know it.

110
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:24,413
-Yeah? You wanna suggest? -The tab tab thing?

111
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:27,741
-Yes, ready? -Prop Tab.

112
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:35,196
-Tab, tab -int Tab Id Enter Enter prop Tab Tab string Enter Tab Name.

113
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:40,480
-How cool is that? -It's cool, and I always forget to use it.

114
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,296
-You gotta use it. -I always forget to use it and it's awesome.

115
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:46,880
-There's so much good stuff in there. -There's also propfull.

116
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,080
-What does that do? -That gives you a backing variable.

117
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:58,550
There's propa,which I don't know what it does but it's crazy.

118
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:02,400
There's propg for a getter with a private setter.

119
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,488
Yeah, a bunch of stuff.

120
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:07,624
-Have you done a blog post on all the properties 

121
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:10,312
There's a bunch of snippets,I could go all day.

122
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:12,680
But I'm just gonna use prop for now.

123
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,584
So this is customer, so customers have an ID,a unique ID.

124
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:18,184
And they have a name.

125
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:20,552
And they could probably have an email,they could have all these things.

126
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:24,392
-Yeah. -We'll start with name for now, but should name have some constraints?

127
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:28,040
-It should. -We have an idea of data annotation.

128
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,088
There's annotation on that data, yes.

129
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:33,096
So one of the things is that you probably want someone to enter their name, right?

130
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:38,408
-We wanna force them. -We wanna force them, so we want to make sure it some sort of required, right?

131
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:43,656
So required, and I'm putting that as a notation here and I'm gonna hit Ctrl+dot, again.

132
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:50,696
When you learn that these things exist and you're thinking about them rather than typing in all this stuff for the using,you're just gonna type required.

133
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:54,600
Hit Ctrl+dot, and then hit Enter.

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:00,296
Line 1 just appeared there And then we'll force the length as well.

135
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:05,032
We'll be silly for a moment, we'll say a length of 10.

136
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:06,824
That's not a very good length.

137
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:08,104
That is not a good length at all.

138
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,024
But that might allow us to do some validation later.

139
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:12,072
And then we'll change it to a longer length.

140
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:15,592
All right, so let's back up for a second and see what we did here.

141
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:20,520
So we have in our start up an InMemoryDatabase.

142
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,824
Not a SQLserver or a.

143
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:25,256
Whatever just in memory database.

144
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:37,401
We have a beginnings of a customer, unique ID and a name Some annotations on it, and then a little class here that's kind of empty.

145
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:43,850
That is our a list of customers and actually what's customer Singular here.

146
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,578
-Yeah. -That should be customers.

147
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:51,978
-Okay, because, you have a set. -This is a set of customers.

148
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:54,474
So the one thing, how are we going to see this information?

149
00:08:54,474 --> 00:09:01,514
Well, we're going to need to probably put some in the database and then,once we have them in the database, list them out.

150
00:09:01,514 --> 00:09:02,922
Like how are we going to visually see it?

151
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:05,610
Yeah, so there's a bit of a chicken and the egg problem there.

152
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,898
Do we make the listing page first and list them out?

153
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:12,202
But we really can't cuz we don't have any.

154
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:13,802
-You don't anything, yeah. -Or we make a create page first.

155
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:17,194
-So it's CRUD. -We'll do the C first, okay?

156
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:20,266
-So over in -The pages folder.

157
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:23,274
Pages, let's do create.

158
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:26,282
Now, we're not going to say new file like we did before.

159
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:29,546
No, you're going to create a new Razor Page or if you go to New File.

160
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:30,954
Let me do that again.

161
00:09:30,954 --> 00:09:34,026
Right click and I have two choices I have new.

162
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:35,818
-And then. -Page or I can say item.

163
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:36,650
Yeah, New Item.

164
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,594
And they should be the option to pick Razor Page.

165
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:43,306
Right, so you got a couple different options here and this is all the different things that you could make.

166
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:56,685
I'm gonna go and right click and say add Razor page, and I wanna point out that I'm not gonna do it for this because it will be a little bit cheating but after we're all done, first, we make you suffer.

167
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:59,053
-And then we show you the easy way And then we show you the easy way

168
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:07,462
We could create that model and say Razor page is using entity framework CRUD, and then it will then scaffold or generate.

169
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:10,342
-Every single -All the hard parts that we're about to do.

170
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:16,550
But it's more fun to do, no no,it's more fun to do it ourselves, don't you think?

171
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,958
-All right. -All right, lets do it ourselves.

172
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,006
People can fast forward if they don't like it.

173
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:24,294
The page name would be create.

174
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:26,854
Uh-huh, and then we're gonna use a layout, we saw that.

175
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:31,014
And then, here it says Generate PageModel,that's that code behind of that page model.

176
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:34,982
We could say no and then do that in line, if we wanted to.

177
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:36,886
All right. So let's see if that works.

178
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,766
Thinking, thinking, thinking.

179
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:42,966
We're gonna watch in the right hand side here as create should appear.

180
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:45,590
And sticking well because it's doing quite a bit of scaffolding.

181
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:50,902
Well, it's scaffolding up some workforce but it's also gonna build the application to see if it still builds.

182
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:54,422
And if it's running a scarf-folder.

183
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:58,262
And scar folder is something that you can go on a nd read about and write your own if you feel like it.

184
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:00,374
So here we gotta create.

185
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:03,574
So let's see what we have in there.

186
00:11:03,574 --> 00:11:04,662
Let's see it gives us a page.

187
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:16,438
It gave us a default model, a title, looks like a header, and then some validation scripts, and then presumably we can just start typing our pages or whatever.

188
00:11:16,438 --> 00:11:18,230
Let's look at the backend.

189
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,478
It made a create model that has a get.

190
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:26,422
So this is the function that happens when we get stuff.

191
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:27,254
Okay.

192
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,198
All right, so we're gonna need to make form code.

193
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:35,510
All right, so form that would have actually just one entry?

194
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:41,974
Yeah, so we'll say enter your name, figure, all right.

195
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:44,079
And who knows if this will work, again, we're gonna learn.

196
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,431
Now, this is interesting, noticed that when I typed form Why is it in purple?

197
00:11:48,431 --> 00:12:02,433
Turns purple, so that is a tag helper, this is some related elements that are gonna be on the server for processing so the server knows about purple elements, and ill do some processing of them.

198
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:12,545
Typically when you're in HTML, you have like a P tag or an image tag or div, and that's just strings that get sent off to the client.

199
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:22,785
But when we're generating this stuff on the server side,there might be an opportunity for ASP.NET Core to improve it,to change it, to add stuff.

200
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:24,385
So it knows about form.

201
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:27,969
Form is a magic tag and we can go and type things like this,you see it says asp colon.

202
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:33,281
Yeah, so is that indication that that is a tag helper or some sort of action?

203
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:35,521
Right these things aren't html.

204
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,289
No.

205
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,569
Those are tag helpers.

206
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:43,265
You'll never see asp hyphen something being sent all the way out to the browser.

207
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:44,545
These are not HTML.

208
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:45,953
They're hints to the server.

209
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:52,225
So if when we run this application, and we go into the F12 tools, we will not see- You shouldn't see those.

210
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:53,185
Okay. Exactly.

211
00:12:53,185 --> 00:12:58,689
So we're gonna say form, this is gonna be basic method= a,yep see- Okay.

212
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:02,017
Get, post, put, delete.

213
00:13:02,017 --> 00:13:03,489
We'll say post So we're gonna go and post.

214
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:05,025
Here's the end of our form.

215
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:07,201
Say div, name, and then we'll need a text box.

216
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:09,313
Yep so some sort of input tag.

217
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:10,273
Yep input.

218
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:11,617
Now, this is interesting.

219
00:13:11,617 --> 00:13:17,441
We could do an input tag the way we usually do or we could say ASP.NET4.

220
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:18,401
Okay.

221
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:22,817
And we're gonna say Customer.Name.

222
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:23,585
Okay.

223
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:25,313
See how it's all purple?

224
00:13:25,313 --> 00:13:30,625
That ASP 4 is gonna look at that model, okay?

225
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:35,425
Now, it's saying here, I don't know what a Customer is.

226
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:37,441
What's going on with that?

227
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,465
It's never heard of Customer before.

228
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,923
We'll come back and fix that in a second.

229
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:44,875
Then we'll have an input for submitting that form, okay?
