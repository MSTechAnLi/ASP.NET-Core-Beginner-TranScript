00:00:01,041 --> 00:00:01,761
Hey, friends!
嘿，朋友们

3
00:00:01,761 --> 00:00:04,113
All right, so we have made a console app.
现在我们已经制作了一个控制台应用

4
00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:09,489
We have explored the documentation.We've installed the .NET Core SDK and Visual Studio Code.
我们也浏览了文档，并且安装了 .NET Core SDK 和 Visual Studio Code

5
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:13,675
-All right, next, let's make a Web Application -Exactly
-好了，那接下来，我们要制作一个 Web 应用 -没错

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:19,702
All right, so if we look at my screen here,we have the folder that I have my console app.
现在看向我的屏幕，在文件夹中已经有我们的控制台应用了

7
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:22,438
And so let's so we have to create a brand new folder.
所以我们必须创建一个全新的文件夹

8
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:23,206
All right. Yeah.
嗯，是这样

9
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:28,294
I just wanna point out that all that did was a WriteLine, and it output it to the console
我们要做一个什么样的程序呢？最起码应该做到通过 WriteLine ，并把内容输出到控制台

10
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:33,142
not particularly impressive, there's no web browser here.
但其实这也没啥特殊的，也没有用到浏览器

11
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:35,158
There's just, Hello Scott.
只是做了一个 Hello Scott

12
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:42,797
-Yeah, we need to when you're learning about a Web Framework, you want to do something on the web. -Absolutely
-嗯，如果你正在学习 Web 框架的话，你肯定会想通过 Web 做一些有趣的事嘛 -当然喽

13
00:00:42,797 --> 00:00:44,189
So let's do it.
我们一定要搞一个大新闻

14
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:46,603
I just wanna juxtapose the difference between the two, so let's take a look at that
我想先比较一下这两个程序有啥区别，让我们来看看那个吧

15
00:00:46,603 --> 00:00:47,446
all right?
好吗

16
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:49,654
So what do you want me to do?
我们应该怎么开始，你有好的建议吗

17
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:51,910
So can I teach you a new trick?
没准我可以教你一个新的技巧

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,726
Let's do it.
可以，来吧

19
00:00:52,726 --> 00:00:58,822
-That you can create your web application and a directory at the same time? -Are you sure?
-你可以在同时创建你的 Web 应用和目录吗 -你确定吗

20
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:00,310
I can do it.Cuz I like making directories.
可以是可以，但我喜欢直接创建目录

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,758
-I know, I know, but like try something new. -All right, all right.
-我知道，但尝试一下新的东西总是好的吧 -对吧

22
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:04,006
-Try something -new, okay. I'll try
-那来吧 -开始吧

23
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:08,518
So dotnet new web -o.
dotnet new web -o

24
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,502
And let's call it mywebapp.
起个名字叫 mywebapp 吧

25
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:18,598
So we, in the previous video,we looked at the different .NET templates that are available.
其实在之前的视频中我们就查看了各类可用的 .N​​ET 模板

26
00:01:18,598 --> 00:01:21,190
Web is just one of the templates. So we looked at console, and now we're looking at web,
Web 只是其中的一个模板，我们已经了解了 console ，现在我们需要看下 web

27
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,030
just for people who might be tuning in now. -Okay.
稍等一下，我觉得有必要等一下屏幕前的小伙伴。 -好的

28
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,942
So hit Enter.
敲下回车

29
00:01:25,942 --> 00:01:27,430
So it says
欸，你看

30
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,798
the template core empty, been created successfully, and it put in a folder called mywebapp.
模板 ASP.NET Core Empty ，已创建成功，并放在了名为 mywebapp 的文件夹中

31
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:37,510
So I like to go and make the directory, and then go into the directory,
你喜欢先创建目录，然后进入目录

32
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,577
and you're saying I can go -o, it'll make the folder and name the thing,all at the same time At the same time.
但是使用 -o 命令，它会同时创建文件夹和同名项目，这两任务同时给你整好了

33
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:43,512
And if you think about it
而且你想想

34
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:49,300
if somebody's following this outside of Windows,the way they created directory there might be a different.
如果有人在 Windows 之外使用这种方法，他们创建目录的方式可能会有所不同

35
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,350
That is a valid point you're right cuz I said, md and they might say, mkdir
说的好，确实是这样，因为我用 md 他们可能会用 mkdir

36
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,414
And that's a good point.
提醒一下小伙伴们

37
00:01:55,414 --> 00:01:56,086
All right, and
好的，还有

38
00:01:56,086 --> 00:02:00,665
when I did that, just as you said, we did a .NET new web.
当我这样做时，就像你说的，我们完成了一个新的 .NET 网站

39
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:07,222
Which is this one this is an empty one. Anyway there's different web options that we'll explore later.
这个应用并没有包含具体内容。当然还有别的可创建网站的选项，那些我们等会说

40
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:11,062
But right now we made the simplest possible web application.
但现在我们完成了最简单的 Web 应用

41
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:16,341
Exactly, just like the step just above a console right at the line. Okay Just right above it
确切的说，创建的时候只用了一行命令就给解决了

42
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:18,885
We can go into let's go into the mywebapp, and
让我们来看看这个程序，先进入 mywebapp （目录），然后

43
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:25,797
I see a csproj which makes sense, I see a Program.cs,
我看到了 csproj ，这是必须有的哈，我还看到了 Program.cs

44
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:30,549
which I had before. But this is something different. I see a Startup.cs and a wwwroot.
之前我们就见过这些文件了，但是这些是与之前不同的。我看到 Startup.cs 和 wwwroot

45
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:33,429
Now we could poke around here at the command line, but you showed me
现在我们可以在命令行中试一下，但是若能打开

46
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:36,741
that VS code is better. It's pretty good.
VS Code 就更好了，它是最方便的

47
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,037
It is better, so
完美

48
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:42,981
let's go into there.Now, this is interesting, by the way, I tagged code dot
让我们在这打开，这就好玩了，顺便说一下，我键入的是 code .

49
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:45,237
it opened up my web application.
它打开了我的 Web 应用程序目录

50
00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:47,781
It's worth pointing out that if you notice in the background
你看到了没，如果你注意到背景

51
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:50,325
there, it also opened my previous windows.
在那里，它也打开了我以前的窗口

52
00:02:50,757 --> 00:02:57,045
VS Code likes to put things back the way it was so it's restoring my session.
VS Code 能够记录你的工作状态并且恢复上次的会话

53
00:02:57,429 --> 00:03:00,309
I'm gonna go and close the console app from earlier.
但是我们要先关闭之前的控制台应用

54
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:04,485
And we'll just say, there's that warning again
欸，它又出现了这种警告

55
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:08,805
required assets to build, it's totally okay to say yes,
为构建添加所需的资源，这毫无疑问的选 yes

56
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:13,797
because we wanna be able to debug our web application, all right
因为我们总希望能够调试我们的 Web 应用，对吧

57
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:15,957
So I noticed you have a couple of things down there
我注意到你在右下角有一些额外的东西

58
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:17,925
are those additional Yeah, that's a great point.
是那些确实是一个值得关注的地方

59
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:21,957
So down here, I've got some extensions,these are like a little accordion extensions
在下方这里，我有一些扩展，这些像小手风琴一样的扩展

60
00:03:21,957 --> 00:03:28,725
If I want to play with Docker, or if I'm gonna be using Git, so GitLens and Docker are extensions.
如果我想玩 Docker ，或者如果我要使用 Git ，那么 GitLens 和 Docker 就是所需的扩展

61
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:36,549
If I click here on the left, you can see my installed extensions,and recommended extensions.
如果我点击左边这里，你可以看到我的安装扩展和推荐的扩展

62
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:41,541
And I could go and search for extensions here as opposed to using the web.
我可以在这里搜索扩展，而不必使用网页版

63
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:44,085
Cuz I was just moving them out of the way.
这里我就把他们移开了

64
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:45,765
All right, cuz I just noticed something different
好的，因为我刚注意到一些不同的东西

65
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:47,637
so I was asking questions for the people at home.
所以我想帮屏幕前的童鞋问一下

66
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:48,645
Definitely useful.
不错的提问

67
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:51,429
So let's just move that out of the way, here we go.
我们先不理它了，继续吧

68
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:55,701
So Program.cs, this is a little bit bigger than it was before.
Program.cs ，这比以前的稍大一些

69
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:59,589
Cuz it's bringing a bunch of stuff that if we look at the previous one
因为它多了一堆东西，如果我们对比一下前一个程序

70
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:03,333
while we putting much only had using systems and maybe IO.
而我们很多时候只使用 systems （指以 System 开头的名称空间），可能还有 IO

71
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:06,165
Actually, that's a good point, let's open up the csproj.
说的好，我们来打开 csproj 文件

72
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:09,045
Yeah. If you recall earlier
嗯 你可以回忆下先前的内容

73
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:16,677
our SDK was Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web,this is a web application.
而在这我们所用的 SDK 是 Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web ，这是一个 Web 应用

74
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:23,589
This is new, indicating that there as a folder called,wwwroot, that we'll talk about in a little bit.
这是新的，还有一个文件夹叫做 wwwroot ，我们稍后再谈它

75
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:28,476
And we have our first package reference, Asp.NetCore
这是我们第一个引用的包， Asp.NetCore

76
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:30,650
specifically .All.
注意到是 .All 了吗

77
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:33,891
So literary everything?
它能包含所有的内容

78
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:34,350
Right.
没错

79
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,988
Now, it could in fact be listed one item at a time,
现在，它可以把一个个的项目分开

80
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:41,244
ASP.NET Core broken up in a lot of different pieces.
ASP.NET Core 能分成许多​​不同的部分

81
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,260
So it's kind of a cafeteria plan.
这些都可以随意组合

82
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,996
Okay. This is a package of packages, so rather than having a list of dozens of different
嗯，这是一个由许多小包组成的大包，有些框架包含了几十个包

83
00:04:49,884 --> 00:04:52,332
packages, and having to pick ones I want, ones I don't want
不管我用不用得到，都给集成上了

84
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:56,604
this makes it much, much simpler.It just gives me everything by default.
当然这也是为了免去麻烦的配置，使得它使用更方便，在默认情况下，它给了我所有的东西

85
00:04:56,604 --> 00:05:00,444
So for learning, it's easier for getting started, it's easier.
对于学习来说，这能使得入门更加简单

86
00:05:00,444 --> 00:05:03,996
If you're familiar with ASP.NET,it's easier because everything you expect is there.
如果您熟悉 ASP.NET 这就更容易了，因为所有你想用的都已经添加上了

87
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:07,500
I was also, one thing I've also noticed,it is one version now
我也这么觉得，我还注意到了一件事，这里有一个版本号

88
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:10,332
It's nice and simple, you just say, I want 2.0 and
这点很好呀，也很简单，你只需说，我想要2.0版本

89
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:13,020
it brings in everything that hangs off of it.
它将决定所有未指定的版本号

90
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,932
Of 2.0, okay
2.0，好吧

91
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:16,140
I call it a metapackage or a package of packages.
我称之为元包或者由程序包组成的包

92
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,116
I like that term, packages of packages.
我喜欢这个词， package of packages

93
00:05:19,116 --> 00:05:20,556
Yeah, nice and simple.
嗯，简单明了

94
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:25,625
So if we go into Program.cs, you saw before we had Using System
让我们打开 Program.cs ，你会看到我们之前用过的 System

95
00:05:26,556 --> 00:05:34,572
And when we say Using System, that was what allowed us to type Console.WriteLine cuz System.Console.WriteLine.
在我们键入了 Using System 后，这将允许我们使用 Console.WriteLine 哦不 System.Console.WriteLine

96
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:41,292
But here this is a web application, and we have other stuff, we've brought in some threading and
但这是一个 Web 应用，并且还加入了其他的东西，我们引入了一些有关线程以及

97
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:44,844
some IO stuff, but this is the ASP.NET Core stuff that's added.
IO 相关的东西，这些就是 ASP.NET Core 所添加的东西

98
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,252
What's worth pointing out those
值得指出的是

99
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:52,572
our Main here is different than our console Main.
我们在这里的 Main 和我们控制台中的 Main 不同

100
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:55,020
Before we had a Console.WriteLine,
之前我们有一个 Console.WriteLine

101
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,836
and that was it.
就是这样

102
00:05:56,364 --> 00:06:00,204
And actually, this is totally off-script
其实，这些都是脚本生成的

103
00:06:00,204 --> 00:06:02,748
which implies of course, that we actually have a script, right?
这当然意味着我们确实有一个脚本，对吧

104
00:06:02,748 --> 00:06:04,750
I wonder if I could do this.
不知道我能不能这么做

105
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:11,801
Okay, I just have a Main
我就只需要一个 Main

106
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,614
and I've commented out all the web stuff.
我已经把所有与 Web 相关的注释掉了

107
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,816
So, what would happen?
那么，会发生什么

108
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:20,096
Let's find out.I wonder if it'll work.
让我们来试一试，我想知道它是否能运行

109
00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:21,632
Remember I've typed, control~?
记得我已经按下了键盘， Ctrl + ~

110
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,621
I think it's tilda.I think if you say, tildi
我认为这是波浪号，如果你说， tildi

111
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:28,475
you might have an accent of some sort, yeah.
你可能就会有某种口音

112
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,956
I think it would be an accent that is completely and
我认为这将是一个彻彻底底的口音

113
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:31,777
totally incorrect.
且完全不正确

114
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:36,934
so it actually switched it over to a Console Application.
所以它实际上就像是一个控制台应用

115
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:39,286
Right. Well, it didn't really switch it over
对的。 其实，它并没有真正地发生改变

116
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:40,630
because it always was a Console Application.
因为它终究是一个控制台应用

117
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:44,902
The idea being that they are the same thing, right?
可以把他们当作一样的东西，是吧

118
00:06:44,902 --> 00:06:49,750
A .NET application has a main entry point, and
.NET 应用程序有一个主入口点

119
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,198
then it does some stuff.
然后它能完成一些工作

120
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,462
And I just wanted to kinda juxtapose that it can do some consoley stuff
我只是想说明它可以作为控制台应用

121
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:58,630
or it can do some webby stuff.
也可以作为 Web 应用

122
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,878
So let's do some webby stuff.
来做一些有关 Web 的程序吧

123
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,654
Like what would it look like out of the box?
就像是开箱即用

124
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:03,334
Yeah, well, that's a good point.
是的，这很好

125
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,214
So let's go back, dotnet run,
所以让我们回到命令行， dotnet run

126
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:09,478
this time having changed it to say BuildWebHost.
这次改变后使用了 BuildWebHost

127
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:14,134
And it's gonna run and build.
它会编译再运行起来

128
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,446
And it says a couple of things.
输出了许多信息呢

129
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,094
It's running in production.
程序正在生产环境中运行

130
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:25,174
It's listening on localhost:5000, so
正在监听 localhost:5000

131
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:27,718
we have started a little web server.
我们启动了一个小型的网络服务器

132
00:07:27,766 --> 00:07:28,102
Okay
嗯

133
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:31,078
Now it says, listening at localhost:5000.
