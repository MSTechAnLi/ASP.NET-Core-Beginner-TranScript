1
00:00:01,664 --> 00:00:04,288
﻿So we're back, and we're going to be looking at pages.
欢迎回来，让我们继续来关注页面

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:09,856
In the previous module,we looked at building our very first empty web application.
在之前的模块中，我们着眼于构建我们第一个空的 Web 应用程序

3
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:12,288
But it didn't really do much, right?
但它并没有太大的作用，对吧？

4
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,312
It just returned a string.
它只是返回一个字符串

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:17,792
And when I think about building a page,I don't know if you think about this the same way.
当我考虑构建一个页面时，我不知道你是否以同样的方式思考这个问题

6
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:18,432
Actually I do.
当然是的

7
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,352
I want to see some HTML.
我想看到一些 HTML

8
00:00:20,352 --> 00:00:27,136
I want to see a physical page structure, and if you actually go back to the project folder
我想看到一个可见的页面结构，并且如果你回到项目文件夹

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:30,912
like all the files that we have, I don't see a single page.
在我们所有的文件中，我没有看到一个页面

10
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:34,368
Right, this is not page focused right now,it's string focused.
对，现在这并不是专注于网页，它专注于字符串

11
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:43,072
And while I could go in and maybe bold face,Beyonce, it's gonna break down very quickly.
虽然我可以修改字符串，也许可以添加加粗效果，Beyonce ，这会很快让人疯掉的

12
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:43,584
Yeah.
是的

13
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:45,696
So, we need a page-focused framework.
所以，我们需要一个专注于页面的框架

14
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:46,336
We do.
确实如此

15
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:55,296
And just to bring it back even just a little bit more,you talked about ConfigureServices and Configure.
现在让我们往上回滚一小部分，你谈到了 ConfigureServices 和 Configure ( Method )

16
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,768
And we're gonna configure our first service here.
然后我们要在这里配置我们的第一个服务

17
00:00:56,768 --> 00:01:00,544
Right.
对

18
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:05,664
Yeah, so, if you type services.AddMVC.
嗯，所以，如果你输入 services.AddMVC

19
00:01:05,664 --> 00:01:08,480
So if I type services.Add,I get all these choices
在我输入 services.Add 之后，我得到了所有这些选择

20
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:10,144
That we saw before.
我们之前也看到过

21
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:14,048
And these are all the different things that can be layered on top of our application.
这些不同的选项都会在 VS Code 上弹出显示（指代码提示）

22
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:21,856
And it's important to understand, like we talked about before, when we pop back out to Program.cs.
所以重要的是要理解，就像我们之前所说的那样，当我们回到 Program.cs （文件）

23
00:01:21,856 --> 00:01:25,504
This is just a Main, remember we did a console app a second ago,
这只是一个 Main 函数，记得我们之前做过一个控制台应用程序

24
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:28,128
but we're building up this pipeline of services.
但我们正在构建服务的 pipeline （管道）

25
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:29,344
So what service do you want me to add?
那么你想要我添加什么样的服务？

26
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:30,368
MVC.AddMVC.
MVC AddMVC

27
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,768
So this is gonna add all the model view controller services that I would potentially want to use.
这将添加所有可能想要用的 MVC 服务 （ M - 模型， V - 页面， C - 控制器）

28
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,968
Okay, now I added it.
好的，现在我已经把它添加上了

29
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:41,696
There was a squiggle, and then the squiggle was gone.
有一个波浪，然后波浪消失了

30
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:44,384
Did it just magically become Mvcf?
它是不是神奇地变成了 MVC 框架？

31
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:49,248
No, cuz remember, we configure our services,and then we need to configure.
不，请记住，我们配置我们的服务，然后我们需要配置

32
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:50,464
So we actually have to use it.
实际上，我们必须使用它

33
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:51,296
Have to use them.
对的

34
00:01:51,296 --> 00:01:52,000
We add them and then we use them.
我们添加它们，然后我们使用它们

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,640
Yeah.
嗯

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,216
Okay.
好的

37
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:54,496
So we app.UseMvc?
我们键入 app.UseMvc ？

38
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:57,952
And I don't think we need.
我认为我们不需要

39
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,320
It's worth pointing out all the different use stuff.
值得指出的是，在这有所有不同的用途的 Use

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,960
A lot of them.
确实有很多

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,112
There's your Facebook, your Google.
这有你的 Facebook ，你的 Google

42
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,816
Mm-hm.
嗯哼

43
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:04,480
Your different, what's called middleware,
各类不同的，所谓的中间件

44
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,040
you'll here about middleware during the advanced stuff,
你会在这里的高级内容了解中间件

45
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,152
but this where making some middleware right now.
但是现在先让我们来使用一些中间件

46
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:14,592
There's two options there, the default route or the regular UseMvc, we're just gonna say UseMvc by itself.
有两个选项，默认路由或经常使用的 UseMvc ，我们在这就使用 UseMvc （ Method ）

47
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:18,112
There's a bunch of options you can pass in.
有很多选项可以传入

48
00:02:18,112 --> 00:02:20,480
We'll talk a little bit about routing later.
稍后我们会谈谈一些关于路由的问题

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,720
So, I say UseMvc.
看下 UseMvc

50
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,920
So, now Mvc is in the pipeline.
所以，现在 Mvc 在管道中

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,288
Yeah, so we can start taking advantage of it.
嗯，所以我们可以开始利用它

52
00:02:28,288 --> 00:02:30,656
I don't think you would need the last lines though.
我不认为你会需要最后一行

53
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:32,448
Well, let's find out if it still runs.
好吧，让我们来看看它是否还能运行

54
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:35,264
All we've done is AddMVC, and UseMvc.
我们所做的只是 AddMVC 和 UseMvc

55
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:40,896
Does Hello Beyhive still happen? Yes.
Hello Beyhive 还会在吗？是的

56
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,816
Now it's bold,because I bold-faced it.
现在它被加粗了，因为我把它加粗了

57
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:50,240
So that points out that it's in the pipeline but it didn't change the behavior of anything.
因此，可以指出的是它正在管道中，但是它什么都没有改变

58
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,416
Yeah, cuz it hasn't been used at this point.
是的，因为在这里它没有被使用

59
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,632
Well, we havent added any pages.
好吧，我们还没有添加任何页面

60
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,448
I do not think,
所以，我并不这样想

61
00:02:56,448 --> 00:03:01,056
since we're going to be using MVC,I don't think we need app.Run any more.
因为我们将要使用 MVC 我并不认为我们会需要 app.Run

62
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,168
I wanna keep it in there, though.
不过，我想保留在那里

63
00:03:03,168 --> 00:03:04,128
If you don't mind,
如果你不介意的话

64
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:11,616
because when we add our pages, I wanna see the relationship between this, which is now called the default route.
因为当我们添加我们的网页时，在默认路由的情况下，我想看到页面与此之间的关系

65
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:13,152
The default route.
至于默认路由

66
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:16,928
This is the thing that happens, if this doesn't happen.
如何默认路由不起作用，那么这些将被执行

67
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:19,680
In the sense of, it runs in order.
就其意义而言，它将按顺序运行

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,320
Yes.
是的

69
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,152
Does that make sense?
这有合理吗？

70
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:21,664
Yeah.
是啊

71
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,264
So let's do the pages you wanna add,
那么，让我们来完成你想添加的页面，

72
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:27,872
and see if Beyonce shows up randomly.
看看 Beyonce 是否会随机出现

73
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:32,160
Yeah, and you mentioned something pretty significant for a lot of newbies.
对，你提到了一件对很多新手来说非常重要的事情

74
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,552
Is that the order in which a code is written matters?
这是代码的编写顺序吗？

75
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,120
It's very much does,especially when you're adding and using things in turn order.
这很重要，特别是当您依次添加和使用事物时

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,560
I believe that, if we went and move MVC down here,we will have a very different experience.
我相信，如果我们把 MVC 放在这里，我们将有非常不同的体验

77
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
Exactly.
没错

78
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,184
And we can maybe experiment with that once we add a few things.
我们可以尝试添加一些东西

79
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:49,760
Yeah, that's add in.
是的，再补充一些东西

80
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,400
Okay.
好的

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,944
Okay, so first thing I wanna do is add a new folder.
好吧，我想要做的第一件事就是添加一个新文件夹

82
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:55,776
All right.
对的

83
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Yeah.
嗯

84
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:01,856
So I'm over here in a Visual Studio code, and I can right click, and say New Folder, or I can click these buttons.
在 Visual Studio Code 中的这个区域，我可以右击，然后新建文件夹，或者我可以点击这些按钮

85
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:10,624
I'm gonna right click and say a New Folder, because I have found that depending  on what's currently clicked on,
当右击的时候会出现 New Folder，是因为在当前点击的地方可以新建文件夹

86
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,312
when you see New Folder-    >> You might end up somewhere else?
当你看到显示 New Folder  -            >> 你要在别的地方建文件夹嘛？

87
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:17,216
It can sometimes be like one folder down,so just gonna watch out for that.
它有时可能会在某个文件夹里面，要注意这一点

88
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:26,880
So, I'm confirming that my Pages folder, you had me add,is at the same level and not accidentally In wwwroot
所以，我确认了我的 Pages 文件夹，你要求我添加，在同一级目录而不是在wwwroot中

89
00:04:26,944 --> 00:04:28,992
Or in the end or wherever.
或者任何其他地方

90
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:31,168
So, it can be a little confusing, all right?
它可能有点混乱，是吗？

91
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:32,128
So, I have a Pages folder.
所以，我有一个Pages文件夹

92
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:35,648
Okay, and now we actually had to need to add a page.
好的，现在我们实际上需要添加一个页面

93
00:04:35,648 --> 00:04:41,088
So if you add New File,and we're going to add a Index.cshtml.
所以如果你添加新文件，我们将添加一个Index.cshtml

94
00:04:41,088 --> 00:04:42,368
C# HTML.
C# HTML

95
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:46,080
Yes, so I always call it C# HTML,
是的，我总是称它为 C# HTML ，

96
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,232
but I was told that that wasn't right.
但是我被告知这是不对的

97
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:49,536
It's not, it's just a RAZOR PAGE.
这没什么，它只是一个 RAZOR 页面

98
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:50,816
It's just a RAZOR PAGE, yes.
这只是一个 RAZOR 页面，是的

99
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:52,480
Okay, ignore that extension.
好的，忽略这个扩展拓展名

100
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,120
Okay.
嗯

101
00:04:53,184 --> 00:04:54,976
That's so clearly says, yes HTML.
很明显，这就是 HTML

102
00:04:54,976 --> 00:04:55,872
Okay.
好的

103
00:04:55,872 --> 00:04:58,112
-All right? -It does.
-是吗？ -的确如此

104
00:04:58,112 --> 00:05:01,824
So first thing I wanna do is add a page directive.
我想要做的第一件事就是添加一个页面指令

105
00:05:01,824 --> 00:05:03,424
So it'd be @page.
所以应该是 @page

106
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:06,368
Okay so, @page, so directive starts with @.
好吧， @page ，所以指令以@开始

107
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:07,328
-Yeah -Okay.
-好 -是的

108
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:11,168
And we'll be seeing a couple of those throughout the day,and seeing what you can do with that.
我们将在今天看到其中的好几个（指令），并且了解你可以用它们做什么

109
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:11,680
All right.
好滴

110
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:16,032
We're just gonna write some HTML, so let's just use a h1.
我们只是要写一些 HTML ，所以我们只需要使用 h1

111
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:20,064
Okay, h, I get IntelliSense, which is nice.
好，我看到了非常棒的智能感知（ IntelliSense ）

112
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:22,112
Hello Beyonce.
Hello Beyonce

113
00:05:28,512 --> 00:05:31,008
Imagine if Beyonce actually learns how code on one of these videos.
想象一下， Beyonce 是否真的通过这些视频学习了如何编程

114
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:36,896
And I don't have a fancy keyboard.
我键盘上没有这些特殊符号

115
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:40,160
You wanna make sure you
你想确保你

116
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,440
I gotta respect her.

There we go.
让我们继续吧

119
00:05:43,424 --> 00:05:47,008
She will appreciate that when one day,when she does watch this video.
有一天，她会感激你的，当她看这个视频

120
00:05:47,008 --> 00:05:49,568
When she does watch this and invite me to her house for lunch.
当她看到这个后邀请我到她家吃午饭

121
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:52,000
All right, do I need to do anything else?
好了，我还需要做其他事吗？

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,896
Yeah, did you save it?
嗯哼，你保存了吗？

123
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,536
Yeah.
是的

124
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:55,840
So let's just see what happens, let's run this.
让我们看看会发生什么，让我们来运行这个

125
00:05:58,592 --> 00:05:59,232
All right.
好的

126
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,584
Do, do, do, gonna go and run it.
加油，继续，让我看到它运行起来

127
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:05,504
It's gonna fire up localhost:5000.
它会监听 localhost:5000

128
00:06:10,112 --> 00:06:11,840
All right.
嗯哼

129
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:12,800
Wow.
哇

130
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,120
That's interesting.
这很棒

131
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:18,752
So Index.cshtml appears to be the default.
所以 Index.cshtml 似乎是默认的（页面）

132
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:19,520
Yes.
是的

133
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:26,752
And I wonder if I change its name Okay?
我想知道我是否可以改名？

134
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:27,648
Let's give it a try
让我们试试看

135
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:29,888
And then just hit Refresh.
然后点击刷新

136
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,408
No, you'd actually now have to-
哦不，你现在实际上应该-

137
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:35,520
No, look, where does that string come from?
不不不，快看，该字符串是从哪里来的？

138
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,512
It came from line, go back.
它来自那行，让我们倒回去

139
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:43,072
Yeah, it came from line 31.
是的，它来自第31行

140
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:50,368
Right, so the point here is that, UseMvc,added some default routing, some behavior.
对，所以这里要说的是 UseMvc 添加了一些默认路由及一些行为

141
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:50,944
Yeah.
是的

142
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:54,848
When we say routing it's like when the URL comes in,it has to make a decision about who's handling this.
我们所说的路由，就像是有 URL 进来一样，它必须决定谁来处理这件事

143
00:06:54,848 --> 00:07:01,760
Exactly, so if you went back to your page,and you did /fred ,would it pop up?
没错，如果你回到你的页面，并且你添加了 /fred ，它会显示什么？

144
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,720
That's a good question.
这是个很好的问题

145
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:11,680
Yes, okay so now we are starting to learn a little bit about the behavior.
对，好吧 现在我们开始对这种行为有所了解了

146
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,608
So by default, just because it's called Index, some magic,
所以默认情况下，它被叫做 Index 这是一个特别的名称

147
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:22,752
not magic with MVC defaults it adds as the a default route.
而 MVC 在默认情况下，则会将它作为默认路由

148
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:23,712
Right, right.
对对

149
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:28,832
Okay, so if we added another page,and maybe we're going a bit too crazy here.
好的，如果我们添加了另一个页面，也许我们这里太疯狂了

150
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:32,608
Mm-hm, want to add another named page?
Mm-hm，想添加另一个被命名的页面？

151
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:34,336
Named page, yeah.
是的，被命名的页面

152
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:37,472
Okay, what do you want to call it?
好吧，你想把它叫作什么？

153
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:37,984
Solange?
Solange?

154
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:39,072
Yeah, or Rihanna, or if, whatever you want.
可以，或者 Rihanna ，都可以啦

155
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:45,152
All right, so, okay here's another one.
好吧，这里有另一个

156
00:07:45,152 --> 00:07:49,888
This page is at I'm thinking it's at-/Solange, right?
我认为这个页面会出现在 /Solange 对吗？

157
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:50,656
That's right.
没错

158
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:51,360
Yeah.
嗯哼

159
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,456
So, we'll just put that in the paragraph tag to be correct.
所以，我们只需将它放在段落标记（ <p></p> ）中即可

160
00:07:55,456 --> 00:08:03,328
See how Visual Studio code is trying to be helpful?
看到 Visual Studio Code 是怎么帮助你的了吗？

161
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:06,784
I should have just opened up my P to start with.
我应该在一开始就键入段落标记的开头 (<p>)

162
00:08:06,784 --> 00:08:07,744
There we go.
继续吧

163
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:12,864
So there is our default.
我们所有都是默认的

164
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:17,600
Did I not run it again?
我没有重新运行它吗？

165
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:19,520
I don't think you did.
我想你没有

166
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:24,768
Okay, so I dotnet run.
好吧，键入 dotnet run

167
00:08:33,984 --> 00:08:35,264
So, there's our default.
这是我们的默认页面

168
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:52,096
And.That one is not showing up.
另一个没有出现

169
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:54,272
It is not.
这并不是

170
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:59,584
Why don't we put it in a folder.
为什么我们不把它放在一个文件夹中

171
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:02,336
Within a folder? Okay.
放在一个文件夹中？好吧

172
00:09:02,784 --> 00:09:04,256
And then, call it Index.
然后，将其称为 Index

173
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:14,688
So, it would have to be Solange/Index then.
所以，它必须是 Solange/Index 吗？

174
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,800
No, cuz Index is the default.
不，因为 Index 是默认值

175
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,008
Interesting.
有意思

176
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:23,712
Hello Beyhive.
Hello Beyhive

177
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:24,736
Let's think about this.
让我们来思考一下

178
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:26,656
What are we doing wrong?
我们做错了什么？

179
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:31,392
This is good though, because we are doing a- We are doing an experiment.
没关系，因为我们正在做一个做一个实验

180
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:33,248
Doing an experiment here and in the process.
在这过程中进行实验

181
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:39,200
We are learning how things work and doing things wrong, right?
我们正在了解这些如何运作，可哪里出错了，对吗？

182
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,352
We are gonna do things together.
我们一起来解决它吧

183
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:44,512
So, I've just changed that real quick, we did Fred before.
所以，我刚刚改变了这里，我们之前做过 Fred

184
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:46,816
I know what it is.
我知道哪里错了

185
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:51,872
-Tell me -All right, check this,friends, out lets go back put it back to Solange this is.
-快告诉我 -好吧，检查一下，朋友们，让我们回去把它改回 Solange

186
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:55,392
Okay, so here's Index.
好的，这里是 Index

187
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:59,360
Look very carefully, there's only a couple lines.
仔细看，这里只有几行

188
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,152
Here's Solange.
这是 Solange

189
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:04,288
We did not put the page directive.
我们没有放置页面指令

190
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:05,760
Yay.
好极了

191
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,912
Okay.
对的

192
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:11,776
Very interesting.
非常有趣

193
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,280
-Interesting, so -It is that that makes it magic,actually it runs if it doesn't see the page directive
-有趣，那么 -实际上在程序运行时候它神奇地完成了这一切，如果没有这个页面指令

194
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,816
and it's never going to.
这个页面将永远不会显示

195
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:20,416
That's not the way it needs to go.
这意味着它没必要显示

196
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,376
Doesn't have to work that way.
不必通过这样执行

197
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:27,200
So, that interesting did not know that I knew it,but like I knew it intuitively.
所以，这个坑我之前并不知道，但我凭直觉猜到了就是这样

198
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,160
But this is something
可这一些东西

199
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,016
that someone at home is going to encounter.
总会有初学者会遇到

200
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:31,168
Yeah, yeah, it absolutely is.
是的，绝对会有的

201
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:32,576
It's definitely something that you're going to encounter
这绝对是你将会遇到的

202
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:37,696
like we hit it, and it was the first thing I told you to do was to add a page directive.
就像我们被它坑到一样，所以，我告诉你，要做的第一件事就是添加页面指令

203
00:10:37,696 --> 00:10:38,400
Yep, absolutely.
是的，一定要记住

204
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,328
And this actually brings up an interesting point about Visual Studio versus Visual Studio code.
这实际上也是一个有关 Visual Studio 与 Visual Studio Code 有趣的地方

205
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:45,760
When we switch over to Visual Studio later
在稍后我们使用 Visual Studio

206
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,600
we gonna add up using the template that are built in.
我们将使用内置的模板来添加内容

207
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,760
So, we gonna go and say file new razor page.
我们只需要创建一个新的 Razor Page 文件

208
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,336
Exactly.
没错

209
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:59,072
And we will get some stuff for free, because we are just making these texts files by ourselves
而且（模板）将会完成一部分的代码，因为我们仅是通过自己来完成这些文本文件

210
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:01,248
we bump into these kind of mistakes,so that's really interesting.
才碰到了这种错误，所以这真的很坑

211
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:06,112
That does bring up the question about the folder thing though,why don't we try that?
这确实提出了有关文件夹的问题，我们为什么不尝试一下呢？

212
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:13,408
Let's make a folder before that,and then we'll move this here.
让我们在那先创建一个文件夹，然后我们把它移动到这

213
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:13,984
Exactly.
没错

214
00:11:13,984 --> 00:11:18,144
And then, change it to Index, which appears to be the default.
然后，将其重命名为默认值 Index

215
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,856
So, if you refresh the page.
那么，如果你刷新页面的话

216
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:23,648
Yes, same page
没错，是同一页面

217
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:26,336
But if I change it here.
但是如果我在这里改变它

218
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:41,312
So, just explore this for a second, it looks like that is
只需探索一下，看起来就是这样

219
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:43,680
not necessary the name of the file, but the path.
没有什么文件名是必须的，除了路径会不一样

220
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,656
So, your default route would be path and then another path,in this case the default page right there, you see?
所以，你的默认路由将是由路径，然后是另一条路径所组成，在这种情况下，默认页面就在那里，你看到了吗？

221
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:54,496
Yeah, so the route is the file structure then?
是的，所以说路由就是文件夹结构喽？

222
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:56,160
The route is the file structure.
对，路由就是文件结构

223
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,680
Which for a page focused framework is a really nice experience.
一个专注于页面的框架是一个非常好的体验

224
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,176
It makes total sense to me.
这对我来说意义重大

225
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:02,816
Right.
对啊

226
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:06,208
Like when you build your first HTML page ever it has the same experience.
就像你建立你的第一个 HTML 页面一样，这会是相同的体验

227
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,384
Yeah, that page within a folder.
是的，一个在文件夹中的页面

228
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:13,822
And that means that when we go later on and make customers,and products, and things like that
这意味着，我们在稍后会做类似消费者，生产者，以及物品的（应用）

229
00:12:13,822 --> 00:12:16,925
it's gonna be really clear about how to do that.
这一思路应该是非常清晰的

230
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:18,808
This is just static HTML though.
而这仅仅的静态的 HTML

231
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:20,797
We should probably add something dynamic
我们应该再添加一些动态的东西

232
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:22,397
before we move on to the next section.
在我们进入下一节之前

233
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:25,138
So, let's give Solange some more information.
那么，让我们来给予 Solange 更多的信息

234
00:12:25,138 --> 00:12:25,150
So, I hear she has a concert today.
那么，让我们来给予 Solange 更多的信息
我听说她在今天有一个音乐会

235
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,274
So, I hear she has a concert today.
我听说她在今天有一个音乐会

236
00:12:28,338 --> 00:12:32,626
Okay, let's assume that it's always now,there is always a Solange concert.
哦好，让我们假设在当前时刻，总是会有 Solange 的音乐会

237
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,906
-There is always a -At any moment.
-那总有一个 -在任何时候

238
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:34,674
Exactly.
好的吧

239
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:36,658
So, we'll have bold thing and what should we say?
我们将会加粗这一信息，我们该怎么说呢？

240
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:46,450
The concert starts at, I don't know, 3pm, right?
音乐会将在什么时候开始，我不知道，下午3点可以吗？

241
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,922
but I wanna have that be dynamic.
但我希望它可以是动态的

242
00:12:47,922 --> 00:12:48,498
Okay.
好吧

243
00:12:48,498 --> 00:12:50,290
How can I make that now.
我应该怎么样让它显示现在的时刻

244
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,826
@DateTime.
@DateTime

245
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:53,554
So, I say, @, again.
好吧，我再次用了 @

246
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:54,386
Yeah.
对的

247
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:57,074
DateTime, which is like System.DateTime
DateTime ，就像是 System.DateTime

248
00:12:57,074 --> 00:12:58,482
.Now
.Now

249
00:12:58,482 --> 00:13:04,434
All right, come back, hit refresh, then hit refresh again.
很好，让我们回来看看，点击刷新，然后再次刷新

250
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:07,314
I'm late I gotta go.
要迟到了，我得走了

251
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:09,298
You gotta go, it's happening.
你确实得走了，它刚开始

252
00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:10,322
It's happening right now.
它现在刚开始

253
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:17,874
Now, it's important to point out that,notice the difference between me making a change.
现在需要指出的是，注意我这样做的区别

254
00:13:19,346 --> 00:13:19,602
Yep.
好的

255
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,042
Control + S, Alt + Tab, refresh.
保存，切换窗口，刷新

256
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,538
I'm not having to build.
我不需要构建

257
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:28,434
-No -Right.
-确实没有 -对吧

258
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:35,922
With razor pages the page is being built when it changes,and it gets hit for the very first time,
对 Razor 页面来说，当它在改变后将会自动构建，而且能很快的响应

259
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:39,954
if I change the C# files I need to then go and rebuild.
可如果我改变了 C# 文件，那我就需要重新构建项目

260
00:13:40,018 --> 00:13:44,050
Okay, but within the page itself you do not need to do that.
对的，但如果是页面自身发生了变化，你就不需要这样做

261
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,866
So, the razor pages, these CSH developed pages.
这些使用 C# HTML 开发的 Razor 页面

262
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,362
They get copied to the host and
他们可以被复制到 host （运行应用程序的主机，或称宿主）

263
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,706
they are part of the source code.
他们也可以是源码的一部分

264
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:55,954
But these .cs files don't get copied to the host,
但是这些 .cs 文件没有被复制到 host

265
00:13:55,954 --> 00:13:58,450
in fact the DLL that they build into does.
事实上，他们被构建为 DLL 文件

266
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,026
Okay.
好吧

267
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,074
Right，that's just a little important thing to point out,
对，这还有一个值得指出的要点

268
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,786
and you can see that if you go and say, dotnet build.
你可以看到这一过程，通过 dotnet build

269
00:14:04,786 --> 00:14:06,514
We've been saying dotnet run.
我们在之前用的都是 dotnet run

270
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:07,346
Yeah.
对

271
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,434
See?
看到了吗？

272
00:14:08,434 --> 00:14:10,354
See how it actually points to your web app?
看到它是如何指向你的 Web 应用了吗？

273
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:14,258
It says, mywebapp is right there.
这样说吧， mywebapp 就在这里

274
00:14:14,258 --> 00:14:16,178
So, I have a question for you.
等下，我有一个问题问你

275
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:18,802
If someone on this, who's watching us right now.
如果有人正在看我们的视频，

276
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:22,578
Like what is that dll thing that he is talking about,
就像他正在讲的 dll 这类东西，

277
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:23,730
where they can learn more about that?
在哪可以让我们的观众了解更多？

278
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,330
All right, so that's called an assembly
好的，这被叫做程序集

279
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,378
it's a dynamic link library if you wanted to learn about
这是一个动态链接库，如果你想知道

280
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:29,682
the details of how assembly's works some things like that.
程序集是怎样工作的细节的话

281
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:31,666
You can go and take a look at some of
你可以去看一些

282
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,010
the intermediate sections on the job.
中间步骤

283
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:37,234
I just wanted to point out that
对此我想说的是

284

some people who are watching this.

I just mean that I need people to understand the difference between

the source code that's in the C sharp files,and the razor pages that are gonna be copied up through the final location.
通过 C# 所写的源代码，与将被拷贝到最终位置的 Razor 页面

00:15:09,362 --> 00:15:12,882
Cool, so this is a little bit of C sharp right here.

Can I say, 2+2?

What are the rules about what you can put in there.

We will kind of explore that a little bit earlier,as we can say at, and then put chunks of code.
我们会稍微探讨一下，正如我们所做的这样，然后把大量的代码放在这里面。

304
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,394
Okay.
