1
00:00:01,216 --> 00:00:04,288
Hey friends, we're gonna talk a little bit about configuration.
嗨，朋友们，我们接下来谈一谈配置吧

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:08,896
But before we do, briefly I got an error before and I wanna fix that.
但是在做之前，我想先纠正一下之前的一个错误

3
00:00:08,896 --> 00:00:10,240
And it was kind of annoying.
这有点烦人

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,975
I was goofing around here, if you look at our Razor, and this is incorrect.
如果你看一下 Razor 语句，我这样做其实并不对

5
00:00:14,993 --> 00:00:20,225
I was being silly and goofing around, and when I was trying to do some math
当我尝试在 Razor 中计算时就会报错

6
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:24,183
inside of my Razor Page, cuz I'm experimenting
现在还没有什么好的解决方法

7
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:28,527
I kept getting this 500 error, this is the kind of error that you'd get in production.
一直得到错误代码为500的错误，这种错误在生产环境中经常会遇到

8
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:33,152
And it's annoying and it's scary, but it's not really helpful to me, is it?
这让人很讨厌，而且对我来说并没有什么帮助，是吧？

9
00:00:33,152 --> 00:00:37,952
Well remember I'm running in production right now.
还好我意识到现在是在生产环境中运行的

10
00:00:37,952 --> 00:00:42,232
Because over here in startup we said
因为在 Startup 这里我们说过

11
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:46,426
if environment is development show this developer exception page
如果是开发环境将会显示这个开发者调试页面

12
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:50,204
You're gonna show me later how to change from development to production
之后会讨论如何从开发环境转到生产环境

13
00:00:50,204 --> 00:00:54,080
but I just wanted to briefly show that of course I can comment things out
但我想先简单地说一下这个事情

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,456
Just like before when we commented out starting a web app and instead changed it back to a console app.
就像以前一样，我们讨论的是一个 Web 应用，而不是控制台应用

15
00:00:59,456 --> 00:01:04,128
What I want to do is make sure that this DeveloperExceptionPage You want to see it, right?
我想要做的是确保这个 DeveloperExceptionPage 能被看到，好嘛？

16
00:01:04,128 --> 00:01:07,008
I want to see it, because I don't want a 500 error,I want a real error.
我想看到调试页面，而不是看到500错误，我想知道真正的错误

17
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:07,968
I want to know what's going on.
我想知道发生了什么事

18
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:12,320
So by removing that line you should be able to then see the mistake.
通过删除该行，应该是能够看到错误的

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,380
Right, now, the right thing to do is to switch to development mode
其实，正确的做法应该是切换到开发模式

20
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:21,206
but we are going to see that a little bit later okay?Now I'll go back here, I'm gonna hit refresh.
但我们稍后来讨论这点好吗？先回到这里，刷新

21
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:23,968
And now I'm getting a development page.
现在我获取了一个开发页面

22
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,568
You don't want to see this in production.
这些在开发环境中应该是不可见的

23
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:32,032
But it's showing me that well, this is not valid,this is not valid Razor, and it gives me the line of code.
它清楚地告诉了我这一行 Razor 代码是无效的

24
00:01:32,032 --> 00:01:33,312
So now I actually know what's going on.
现在我终于知道发生什么了

25
00:01:33,312 --> 00:01:34,848
And I'll go back over here.
回到这里

26
00:01:34,848 --> 00:01:37,536
Could you go back to your home page?
能回到刚才的页面吗？

27
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,136
If you hit on the + button.
如果你在这点击 + 按钮

28
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:43,424
Okay, give me a little context of where it is in the page.
很好，我看到了它在页面中的一部分上下文

29
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,880
Because if it was thousands of lines,I might not know exactly where that was.
因为如果有千上万行的代码，我可能无法定位到它在哪里

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,730
-Good point, -all right.
-好主意 -当然喽

31
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:54,229
So instead of doing my 2+2 there,I am going to say @ and I gonna open a little block here.
所以, 不要在那计算 2+2 ，在这输入 @ 加上大括号

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:03,440
And we'll just make a variable like i,I'll do my 2+2 and then I will say i pm.
然后声明一个用于保存 2+2 的变量，再把这边改成 i pm

33
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,312
So if I made a mistake in here.
如果我在这里犯了一个错误

34
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:17,984
Forget to put the var.
故意忘记加入 var

35
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:19,584
It should give you an error.
应该会报错

36
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:24,064
It should say i does not exist and tell me the line.
它会说 i 并不存在，并告诉我错误在哪一行

37
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:30,144
So it's compiling that Razor Page the second that I hit refresh, all right?
在我点击刷新之后，它会重新编译 Razor 页面，是的吧？

38
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:32,704
-Interesting. -Good reminder.
-有趣 -很好的提示

39
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:34,112
It is a good reminder.
这是一个很友好的提示

40
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
So I'm just goofing around there.
警告我刚刚偷懒了

41
00:02:37,248 --> 00:02:40,100
What we'll learn about a little bit later is how to set this environment so that it is in development
待会我们就学习怎么把环境设置为开发环境

42
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,650
so I don't have to comment that line out
那样也就不用把这一行注释掉了

43
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,326
So out of curiosity this isn't something that people would want to do in practice would they?
那为什么我们不在页面里就完成这部分计算呢？

44
00:02:47,326 --> 00:02:50,275
Like by ejecting bits of C# everywhere into their code?
反正页面和后端都是用 C# 写的

45
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:52,175
Well it depends, that's good point.
问得好，这一点很重要

46
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:58,834
So we'll talk a little bit when we get a little further on the day about the responsibilities of a Razor Page
我们稍后再谈一点关于 Razor 页面的需求

47
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:03,844
vs the responsibilities of the page model or the code behind
以及页面模型或代码背后的需求

48
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:09,038
It is okay to do calculations in what's called the view
如果它们是基于视图

49
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:14,240
if they are view based calculations if they're stuff that's not business logic
而不是业务逻辑的话，在视图中进行也是可以的

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,225
For example,I don't think I would wanna calculate tax rates and shopping
例如，根据单一职责原则

51
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:20,846
for values in here from a responsibilities perspective
我不想在页面中计算税率和购买价值

52
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,675
But certainly I can chop up strings and do different kinds of
当然，我可以在这里加入一些

53
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:28,675
stuff so it is okay to inject little bits of C# in here.
例如用于分割字符串等功能的 C# 代码

54
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:33,975
It's more about is it gonna be maintainable for the rest of the team.
更重要的是它能够方便团队的其他成员维护

55
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:43,552
So we talked earlier, you had me talk about the difference between ConfigureServices and Configure.
所以我们早些时候谈过 ConfigureServices 和 Configure 之间的区别

56
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:46,675
I'm afraid we're going to insert another word that sounds like configure.
恐怕我们会使用另一个听起来像 configure 的词

57
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:52,385
I know, it's just like it's configuration, configure,configure it more, and configure it a little bit more.
我知道，听起来像是 configuration ，但 configure 用的多

58
00:03:52,385 --> 00:03:54,000
That is software engineering, isn't it?
这就是软件工程，是吗？

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,925
It's mostly configuring things and running things.
它们主要掌管着配置和运行工作

60
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:59,040
Yeah, and they all have around the same names, so yeah.
是呀，他们的名字都很相像

61
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,668
So this module's configuration,what are we configuring in this context?
我们在模块配置这方面做了什么？

62
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,064
So I wanna show you how to add configuration into your application.
等会，我想告诉你如何将配置添加到应用程序中

63
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:13,376
That means like switches, options, things that you would,configuration for your app.
这有点像交换机，通过选项来为你的应用进行配置

64
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:16,000
That is different from setting up your services.
但这跟设置服务是不同的

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,304
-Exactly -Okay, all right.
-确实 -好的

66
00:04:18,304 --> 00:04:20,352
So if you open up, are we in Startup?
你打开了嘛，我们是在 Startup 文件中嘛？

67
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:21,312
We are in startup.
是的

68
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:23,744
-Yes, we are -We call it Beyonce,which is probably gonna confuse people.
-好的 - 我们叫它 Beyonce，这听起来是不是怪怪的

69
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:27,840
I know, should we still call it Beyonce?
也是哈，那我们还叫它 Beyonce 吗？

70
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,000
We should probably change it back to startup because we don't want to lose our jobs.
我们还是把它改回去吧，我们可不能因为这个出差错

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,224
Let's just change it back to startup.
让我们把它改回去

72
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:43,392
Okay, we're in the Startup class.
还是 Startup 类

73
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:45,632
Cool, and we want to pull information out of a config file.
酷，我要从配置文件中获取信息

74
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:46,784
-Yes we do -Where is the config file?
-来吧 -配置文件在哪里？

75
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:47,680
In IConfiguration.
在 IConfiguration 这儿

76
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:50,944
Yeah but the name, the file itself, the settings for the application.
我说的是这应用程序程序的配置文件的名称

77
00:04:50,944 --> 00:04:54,976
You actually have to add, you mean you add your app json?
你要往你的的应用程序中添加 json ？

78
00:04:54,976 --> 00:04:56,256
Is that what you're looking for?
要不然是在找什么？

79
00:04:56,256 --> 00:04:57,984
Your app settings right, so let's do that first.
若你的应用设置正确的话，就让我们开始吧

80
00:04:57,984 --> 00:05:00,544
So appsettings.json.
appsettings.json

81
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:05,152
That's the default name for settings for your app.
这是应用设置的默认名称

82
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:08,882
Now I can put anything in here right,as long as it's json it's totally up
现在我可以把任何东西放在这里，只要它是json就可以了

83
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:08,927
Now I can put anything in here right,as long as it's json it's totally up
无论我想要的配置信息是什么

84
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:11,450
whatever configuration information I want right?
无论我想要的配置信息是什么

85
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:14,169
So we'll have like some message.
我们会收到一些消息

86
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:19,360
Yeah it can be like friendly call from Beehive or hello from.
它从 Beehive 获知 Hello 的友好消息

87
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,500
Yeah, here's a greeting.
这是一个问候

88
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,075
From the config
在配置里

89
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:35,615
And you're configuration it really can be anything that is application specific,any name value pair.
你可以把它配置为任意的一个名字

90
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,375
Exactly, so you could have logging over there as well,could you not?
你也可以在别处看到这个信息对吗？

91
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:43,009
Yeah, we'll see a little bit later we'll have the logging levels.
可以，稍后我们会看到我们的日志系统

92
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:47,622
It can be, there'll be a place to put connection strings and all kind of stuff.
它可能会有一个放置连接字符串等数据的地方

93
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:50,711
And we'll talk about the differences between where user secrets go
我们将讨论用户隐私数据

94
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:52,996
where connection strings go and where non secret things go
字符串连接和公开数据的异同

95
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:55,925
So just for reference for people who are going to be watching this
因此，给你们一点参考

96
00:05:55,925 --> 00:06:00,575
when I've been using the app settings I've been using it mainly for configuration of my database
我配置数据库的时候都会以此进行应用程序设置

97
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,446
Okay, so it depends on whether the configuration for your database is a secret.
好的，这取决于数据库的配置是否是机密

98
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:05,534
It's a secret.
这是一个机密

99
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:07,582
-Or not -It should be a secret.
它应该是一个秘密

100
00:06:07,582 --> 00:06:13,526
It should not have been there,do not do this, although it's defaulted in the template.
它不应该把你的连接字符串放在那里，尽管它在模板中是默认的

101
00:06:13,526 --> 00:06:15,894
-But as someone -Well let's take a look at the template.
但是有人... - 让我们来看看模板

102
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:17,400
But as someone who has put apps into production
但是，作为将应用程序投入使用环境的人员

103
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,696
what are some of the most common things that you have actually used something like this for?
实际上使用类似这样的东西的一些最常见的事情是什么？

104
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:27,025
So let's say maybe like someone's email address
因此，让我们假设为别人的电子邮件地址

105
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:34,250
or I might have if I'm writing a blog number of posts on homepage, ten, whatever.
或者正在博客的主页上撰写帖子

106
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:44,094
It could be anything that is a quick little switch or change that you might want to pop in a config file and update.
在任何你需要配置的文件中它可以是一个快捷的开关或更改方式

107
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:47,625
And what's nice aboutconfiguration as it's configurable
关于配置的话，因为我们使用的是 json，所以配置起来很方便

108
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:51,198
we're using json it could be an ini file,it could be an XML file
它可以是 ini 文件，也可以是一个 XML 文件

109
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:53,182
It could be a database somewhere.
它也可以是某处的数据库

110
00:06:53,182 --> 00:06:59,454
Any of the kinds of options that you want show ads on the homepage.
任何类型的选项都可以，比如你想在首页展示广告的话

111
00:06:59,454 --> 00:07:04,190
I was just thinking about things that I do on my blog,that kind of stuff.
或者说在博客上添加一些自定义的内容

112
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:09,182
Cuz I think people see and they just what is that about and they think it's important to understand
因为我想人们看见就会去想这到底是什么，是否便于理解就非常重要

113
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:12,190
Showing Messages is a silly kind of generic kind of thing.
用 Messages 这些形式就很不友好

114
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,518
Like these are some real world examples.
这些是现实生活中的一些真实的情况

115
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:20,766
Yeah, like if you were having paging, PageSize before I hit next, next or whatever.
是的，如果你要设置分页，可以用 PageSize 设置每一页的数量

116
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:23,646
So if I have 100 blogs post,maybe my PageSize is gonna be 10.
如果我有100个博客发布，也许我的 PageSize 将是10

117
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:29,790
These are the kinds of things you wanna have in a config file somewhere that you can then pull out in your code.
你可以通过代码获得你想要从配置文件中得到的数据

118
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,710
So we're gonna figure out how to pull that out, all right.
我们要弄清楚如何解决读取配置，是吧

119
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:38,878
So let's go back to startup and configuration is a service.
所以让我们回到 Startup ，配置信息也是一项服务

120
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:44,152
It's a thing like logging is a service, you had MVC as a service
它就像日志、 MVC 一样是服务

121
00:07:44,152 --> 00:07:48,824
so we need to make sure that we can inject that service
所以我们需要确保注入了这项服务

122
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:53,214
That's a dependency that we're gonna inject into our system okay.
这是我们要注入系统的依赖

123
00:07:53,214 --> 00:07:56,094
Dependency injection how much do you wanna talk about that?
你想谈谈依赖注入吗？

124
00:07:56,094 --> 00:07:59,050
I'm going to talk about that a little bit more in a different one.
我会在另一章中再探讨这个话题

125
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,763
So for now we will just assume that
我们会在稍后深入研究

126
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:04,798
we'll give you a little bit of background before we get deeper into it later
在这之前先了解一下基础知识吧

127
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:10,641
So I'm gonna just make a constructor, right,my Startup constructor here.
我会在这里创建一个构造函数，我的 Startup 类的构造函数

128
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:17,083
And whatever parameters the startup constructor has will be
无论 Startup 的构成函数需要什么参数

129
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,326
given to me automatically by the system.
系统都会自动为构造函数提供参数

130
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:21,310
They'll be injected directly to the system.
他们将直接注入其中

131
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:30,782
So I need the ability to have an IConfiguration, and this is a little trickier, let's watch this very careful.
所以我需要有 IConfiguration ，这有点棘手，让我们仔细观察一下

132
00:08:30,782 --> 00:08:34,110
I'm gonna type IConfiguration, and at the end of it,see it how it's all squiggly.
我输入 IConfiguration ，并在最后看到它产生怎同样的变化

133
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,862
-Yeah -I'm gonna hit Ctrl+dot.
-嗯嗯 -按下 Ctrl + .

134
00:08:36,862 --> 00:08:38,462
And it gives you the options.
这里出现了一些选择

135
00:08:38,462 --> 00:08:41,662
And it says, well, do you make one of these?
它是在说，这里面有你想要的吗?小伙子~

136
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:44,670
Or is it the one, do you mean this one here?
你是说这个，还是那个？

137
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,718
We mean that one there.
我们指的是那个

138
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:47,600
Right, and there's actually two options.
对，实际上有两种选择

139
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,506
You can add the using statement.
你可以添加使用语句

140
00:08:49,506 --> 00:08:59,006
Or fully express it almost like a path like C:/, whatever, whatever, whatever.
或者通过这种像 C:/ 的绝对路径的方式来直接使用了

141
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,502
It's that full path, to IConfiguration.
这就是 IConfiguration 的完整路径

142
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:03,486
That wouldn't make it available to the entire program.
但这不会使整个程序都可用

143
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,790
And we'd have to do that every single time we used it.
我们每次使用它都必须这样做

144
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,710
-Yeah. -Exactly, good point.
是啊 - 好的，那就这样吧

145
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,126
So we'll say using, and then watch up here on line 8, so watch at line 8.
我们来添加 using ，然后注意看着第八行

146
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:14,878
Ta-da, yeah.
塔达，是的

147
00:09:14,878 --> 00:09:16,350
So it just drops in there automatically.
它会自动添加到哪里

148
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:23,454
So Startup, our Startup class, is gonna need IConfiguration,and we can call it whatever, call config.
Startup，我们的 Startup 类需要 IConfiguration ，我们可以调用它来配置

149
00:09:23,454 --> 00:09:28,318
And then we're gonna store it away,cuz they're gonna pass it in to us, they're gonna make one.
然后我们会把它储存起来，因为它会在这里传给我们一个对象

150
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:33,150
And this is important, we'll talk about dependency injection later
这很重要，我们稍后会讨论依赖注入

151
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:38,622
but the part that you need to remember is that you don't need to make one, you just ask for it
但是你记住你不需要创建一个新的对象，你只需要用它就可以了

152
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:42,142
And by asking for it, we put it in as a parameter.
把它作为一个参数来使用它

153
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:44,830
So we don't actually go and say new, whatever.
我们实际上并不会去新建一个对象

154
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:51,678
So I'll say public IConfiguration,and we can name it Configuration.
接着创建一个公开的 IConfiguration ，我们可以将其命名为 Configuration

155
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:54,110
-Yeah. -And this is gonna be a property.
-是啊 -这是一个属性

156
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,710
Yeah, so have a get and a set.
是的，所以需要 get 和 set 方法

157
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,758
Get in the set, excellent.
get 和 set ，完美

158
00:09:57,758 --> 00:10:04,670
And then, we just squirrel it away as they say.
然后，我们把参数 config 的值赋值给 Configuration

159
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,846
Configuration = config.
Configuration = config

160
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:12,125
So they pass it in when we start up
当我们启动 Startup 类的时候

161
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:16,830
and we stick it over here,which then presumably means I can use it, right?
就意味着我们可以使用 Configuration，对吧？

162
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,374
Yes, you can so you should be able to use it right from your page.
是的，你可以在任何页面中都可以使用它

163
00:10:21,374 --> 00:10:23,376
I can use it wherever.
任何地方

164
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:27,225
It should be setting around, so I could be down here
在这里进行配置

165
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:35,390
I was gonna say this.Configuration and then those are all the things one can do.
键入 this.Configuration 这些就是我们可以做的事

166
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,742
Now that is within my C# application.
现在在我的 C＃ 应用程序中

167
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:42,650
My C# code, my Startup.cs
我的 C＃ 代码，我的 Startup.cs

168
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:48,500
but if we go back over here, let's go to our index one, our Beyonce RAZOR PAGE
但如果我们回到这里，到我们的 Beyonce Razor 页面

169
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:51,518
You said I can use it from within here directly.
你说我可以直接在这里使用它

170
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,694
Yes, but we need to inject it first.
是的，但我们需要先注入它

171
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:59,326
Okay, so just like it was, inject it in,it was made available.
好吧，就像这样，注入它，就可以使用了

172
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,926
Mm-hm.
嗯

173
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,334
Inject is kind of an intense word.
注入是一个听起来很牛的词

174
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:03,038
I know.
我知道

175
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,150
I asked for it, and they gave it to me.
我发起请求，然后就能得到它

176
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:08,350
I think eject is a little intense, but-Please.
我认为直接弹出会有点不合适，但 - 没关系

177
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,854
So I'll say h2, h2.
先加入一个 的标签

178
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:17,793
No, can I say @Config?
我可以输入 @Config 吗？

179
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:19,450
Can I just go and say, Config?
我能直接输入 Config ?

180
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:20,681
Yes you can, @Config would, yeah.
可以呀，用 @Config 就可以

181
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:22,537
But I can't, because it hasn't been injected yet.
但是我不能，因为它还没有被注入

182
00:11:22,537 --> 00:11:26,889
No, you actually have to have @inject Configuration.
不，你实际上必须有 @inject Configuration

183
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:29,321
Okay, so up here where it says @page
好的，在上方这里有一个 @page

184
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,857
Yeah,you need a new directive.
是的，你需要一个新的指令

185
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,865
I need another directive, I need to go inject, okay?
我需要另一个指令，来进行注入，对吗？

186
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:38,473
And then, when I say IConfiguration, though,it's not gonna work.
当我输入 IConfiguration 时，它没有奏效

187
00:11:38,473 --> 00:11:41,225
Yeah, because we can still need to inject the using statement.
是的，因为我们仍然需要注入使用语句

188
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:47,800
We have to add the using statement, so using and a bit later on
我们必须添加使用语句，以便稍后使用

189
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,257
we'll see how to do this for every page, instead of having to do it on one page, but I'm gonna say using.
我们将看到如何为每个页面执行此操作，而不必在每一页上完成

190
00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:59,401
Then I will say inject IConfigaration,and we will just call it Configuration.
然后我会注入 IConfigaration ，叫它 Configuration

191
00:11:59,913 --> 00:12:02,921
So this is asking for it.
这用来充当请求

192
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:07,575
-Yes. -Okay, and then down here, I could say Configuration
-是的 -好吧，然后在这里，我可以输入 @Configuration

193
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,160
and we called it We called a whole bunch of things.
然后可以调用这所有的东西

194
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,056
We say message.
比如说 Message

195
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:13,272
-Okay. -Message.
-好的 -那就 Message 吧

196
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:16,500
Cuz it's just a bag, a bag of stuff.
因为它只是一个包，一包数据

197
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,640
Oops, I can do it on multiple lines, I'll do it on one line.
哎呀，我可以一行上完成，不用占这么多行

198
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,864
All right, let's see if that breaks.
好吧，让我们看看是否会报错

199
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:31,150
That's my positive attitude speaking.
讲真我还是很乐观的

200
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:37,464
-Keeping it real. -Yeah, let's see if that breaks,that's the attitude of the developer.
-让事实说话吧 - 好，让我们看看这是否能运行，这是开发者一定要做的

201
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,576
I think it'll be okay.
我认为这没有问题

202
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:42,968
-Breaking things is fun, then you get to fix them, right? -That is true.
-中断让事情变得有趣，然后你就可以解决它们，对吧？-确实是的

203
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:47,275
So that's our Solange page, let's look at our home page
所以这就是我们的 Solange 页面，让我们看看我们的主页

204
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:50,225
here it go, here's a greeting from the config file.
在这里，这些数据可是来自配置文件的

205
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:53,208
Let's go back and change that.
让我们回去变一下

206
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,552
-To another greeting? -Yeah.
-改成别的值吗？-是啊

207
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:06,641
All right, so that's coming out of that config file,we changed the config file
好吧，数据是由配置文件设定的，我们更改了配置文件

208
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:11,300
and the value changed,we did not change the code, all right?
数据就会发生变化，我们可是没有更改代码，对吗？

209
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,624
-Yeah -That's pretty cool.
-对 -这很酷

210
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:16,184
It's worth pointing out a couple of things, though.
不过，值得指出一些事情

211
00:13:16,184 --> 00:13:20,984
First, we have a using statement in our RAZOR PAGE,just like we did over in our CS.
首先，我们在 RAZOR 页面中有一个使用声明，就像我们在 C# 中所做的一样

212
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:22,648
I wonder.
我在想

213
00:13:24,632 --> 00:13:25,848
Could I do this?
我可以这样做吗？

214
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:31,288
-It should be a dot, right?
-它应该是一个点，对吧？

215
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,336
-Right, thank you.
-对，谢谢

216
00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:37,176
So fully qualified path, yes -It worked.
所以完整路径也是可行的 - 是的

217
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:39,224
Well, it worked and that it didn't break
它在正常运行，并没有受影响

218
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:40,952
Okay, it worked.
好的，运行正常

219
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:43,448
-Alright -Yeah, it worked in quotes.
-好吧 -嗯，一切正常

220
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:47,883
So that's interesting, I can back out of that, and then I later on
这很有趣，我可以退出来

221
00:13:47,883 --> 00:13:52,216
we'll see how we could make that configuration available ever with.
然后我会看到我们如何使配置可用

222
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:54,003
-Yes. -Cuz I don't wanna have to keep adding.
-是 -因为我不得不继续添加

223
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:56,371
Cuz always could have to add it to every single page that you have.
总是可以将其添加到您拥有的每一个页面中

224
00:13:56,371 --> 00:14:01,427
Yeah, I have got three lines of directives here and we got two lines of HTML, so that's real fun.
是的，我在这里有三行指令，我们有两行 HTML ，所以这真的很有趣

225
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:05,976
-Yeah. -Okay, so I think we'll take a break and then we'll graduate to Visual Studio Proper.
-是啊 -好吧，让我们休息一下，然后我们将开始正确地使用 Visual Studio

226
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:07,768
Yes, we are. -Very cool.
-是的 -很酷
