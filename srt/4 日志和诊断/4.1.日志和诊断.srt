00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,416
-Alright, we survived the crud -Yeah, we did
-终于，我们完成了 CRUD -是的，我们做到了

4
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:05,952
Create, read, update, delete
创建，读取，更新，删除

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,304
We are going to add in some logging, do a little Application Insights locally
接下来，我们将来添加日志功能，并在本地执行 Application Insights

6
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:15,808
and then in the process of doing logging, I also want to add a little thing called Temp Data
然后在记录日志的过程中，我还想添加一个名为 Temp Data 的小东西

7
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:19,392
Because I was noticing that when we did the create
因为我注意到，若在我们进行创建的时候

8
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:24,640
it'd be nice to have a little message that said the answer was created or whatever
能有一条消息表示正在创建或者其他提示，这样会更友好

9
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:25,600
Yeah, that would be nice.
嗯嗯，听起来不错

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:25,664
但这并不是模型的一部分，因此这会带来一些有趣的问题

11
00:00:25,664 --> 00:00:30,130
But that's not really part of the model cuz that brings up some interesting questions
但这并不是模型的一部分，因此这会带来一些有趣的问题

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:30,144
But that's not really part of the model cuz that brings up some interesting questions

13
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:36,800
So, for example, if we go back to Create and just refamiliarize ourself with that, right?
例如，如果我们回到 Create 页面，对此我们都还有印象，是吧

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:47,232
We type in the name and we hit submit, and then if we look at the page model behind
我们输入名称，然后点击提交，在让我们看下相关的页面模型

15
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:48,960
that it's pretty straightforward, right?
一目了然，对吧

16
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:53,184
We have the customer that as you say with the BindProperty survives
我们有使用了 BindProperty 属性的用户，就像你说的

17
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,175
Survives the journey.
幸存的旅程

18
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:59,904
Survives the journey but it'd be nice to have a message that would be some temporary piece of data
幸存下来的旅程，但我们希望有一些像临时数据之类的

19
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,464
that would say, yeah customer got added
消息提示我们，用户添加成功了

20
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:05,856
So we could go and have a string and call it message.
所以我们可以添加一个字符串变量叫做 message

21
00:01:06,112 --> 00:01:13,088
This is interesting though because it's part of the PageModel, but not part of the database.
这很有趣，因为它是页面模型的一部分，但不是数据库的一部分

22
00:01:13,152 --> 00:01:17,632
This is part of the PageModel which is kinda like a view model.
这是页面模型的一部分，它有点像视图模型

23
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:21,280
This is really a temporary piece of data.
这实际上是一段临时的数据

24
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:28,192
It's Tempdata and they're gonna have their values stored and then they'll be right back around in the side.
这就是 Tempdata ，他们将在这储存相应的值，然后可以在另一个页面中访问

25
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:29,600
So it's a sidecar, it's a little post it note.
所以这就像是一个车斗，或者说是便利贴

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,056
That's a good way to think about those. Yeah.
这种思考问题的角度很不错。是的

27
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:34,848
Cool, so it's a place to put stuff.
很好，这就是一个放东西的地方

28
00:01:34,848 --> 00:01:39,072
So I'm gonna save the database, save the data right here like we did before and then-
首先，我要保存数据库，就像我们之前那样保存数据，然后

29
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,992
You're gonna have a message.
你会收到一条消息

30
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:46,240
I'm gonna have a little message, and we'll say hey, Customer and this is where you can personalize stuff.
我将收到一些消息并提示，嘿，Customer ，在这里你可以自定义一些东西

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,800
-Customer.Name -added
-Customer.Name -added

32
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:53,024
-It's a message, right? -And it can come out of whatever you want
-这是一条消息，对吗？ -它可以来自你想要的任何东西

33
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:58,144
It can be generated, but here we're mixing and matching text with the data from the form.
它可以是生成的，而在这里我们将拼接文本与来自表单的数据

34
00:01:58,144 --> 00:02:03,136
Then scrolling in a way in this message which is not part of the database.
然后回过头我们再来看下这个 message ， message 并不是数据库的一部分

35
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:08,128
So by simple fact that you had the TempData said, you're not going into the database.
所以，在这个简单的实例中，你使用的是 TempData ，而不必访问数据库

36
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:12,736
Right because I posted, well because I actually never picked it up and put it anywhere near the database.
是的，因为我提交了表单，而实际上我从来没有把它存到数据库的任何地方

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,475
If I did not put TempData on it, that would never get saved and it would be no
如果我没有在上面添加 TempData ，那它永远都不会保存下来，也不会

38
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:28,096
But because it's public and it's on the page model, it's available to me, you know, elsewhere, okay?
但是因为它是在页面模型上的 public 属性，所以我可以在其他地方使用它，对吗？

39
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:32,832
So let's go over to, let me think about this.
让我们回过头来，想一想

40
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:38,080
-Would you go to your index page? -Yeah, thank you
-是该到你的索引页面了吧？ -是的，谢谢

41
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,872
It took me a second to get my head right
我花了一秒钟让我的头脑清醒了一下

42
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:45,184
So on the index page, we're gonna go and make a message as well
所以在索引页面上，我们也会添加一条消息

43
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:52,736
That's gonna catch that temp data, right?
那会获得那些临时数据吧？

44
00:02:53,475 --> 00:03:04,512
And then here, maybe we'll have some, we'll just take it at the top of the form for now and we'll say, maybe an H3.
然后在这里，也许我们需要一些，就把它放在表格的顶部，比如说是 H3 标签

45
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,592
-And some sort of message? -@Model.Message
-以及一些消息？ -@Model.Message

46
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,918
So it'd be or maybe we'd wanna hide it if it wasn't there
所以它将是这样，也许在消息不存在的时候

47
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:17,151
there is lots of things that we could could potentially do but for now
我们会想隐藏它，我们可以做很多的事情，但现在

48
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:18,784
Now, just a second, we'll be fine.
现在，只需一秒钟，我们这样就可以了

49
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:23,600
But this is just an example where it's not quite database stuff.
但这只是一个例子，它与数据库无关

50
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,848
You don't want to stick it in the database temporarily, you just want it to be somewhere temporarily
你并不想把数据临时保存到数据库中，仅仅是想找个地方临时保存下数据

51
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:29,600
Some sort of acknowledgement for the user
一些用户的操作信息

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,163
-Mm-hm, yep and the general idea of being able to, there you go -They are
-嗯，是的，这是一种常见的想法，这就可以了 -这些就是了

53
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:36,603
And that could look whatever you want it, you can do whatever.
这可以你想要的任意的东西，或者你想对它做任何操作都行

54
00:03:36,603 --> 00:03:42,464
It could fade in with jQuery or animation, or whatever makes you happy.
它可以通过 jQuery 或动画添加淡入效果，或任何你喜欢的东西

55
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:52,192
-And that's different from there, which is your default state, right? -So do it again, See?
-（刷新后）这与刚才不同，这是默认状态，对吗 -让我们再来试一次，看到了吗

56
00:03:54,304 --> 00:04:02,624
And it's because it was called temp data and we had the same name here and where it started
这是因为它被称为临时数据，我们在这里和它最初定义的地方有相同的名称

57
00:04:02,624 --> 00:04:08,896
So it found its way magically over into the index area as well, which is pretty sweet
所以它就很神奇地来到了索引页面，多么贴心的功能啊

58
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:14,976
Now we talked a little bit about logging, very, very briefly
现在我们非常非常简短地来谈谈有关日志的事

59
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,125
-We didn't really do anything with it -Well we looked at this
-我们不会在日志中真正的做什么 -让我们来看下这个

60
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,800
-Well we saw it up here -We saw two different kinds of logging
-在这我们可以看到了 -我们看到了两种不同的日志记录

61
00:04:20,864 --> 00:04:28,288
-We saw this one -And then we saw a little bit more there.
-我们看完了这个 -然后我们看到了更多信息

62
00:04:28,288 --> 00:04:32,050
so there was warning, and then there was.
这些是警告的等级，然后这些是

63
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:36,575
Oops, pardon me.
哎呀，原谅我

64
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:39,104
It was, yeah there you go.
哦，这就是了

65
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:42,691
There's warning, and then there's debug and then you can have different subsections.
这里有警告，有调试，而且你可以有不同的小节

66
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:48,768
You can say, I just want information from Microsoft but I want debug from everyone else, right?
你可以说，我只想要来自微软的信息，但我希望得到其他人的调试信息，对吧？

67
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:51,328
So let's go see if we can figure out how to do logging.
那么我们来看看，我们是否可以弄清楚如何记录日志

68
00:04:54,656 --> 00:05:02,464
All right, so we'll go back over to here, and I'm going to try to remember how to do this from scratch.
好的，我们回到了这里，我将尝试记住如何从头开始

69
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:04,960
Do you can you tell me how?
你能告诉我该怎么做嘛

70
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,560
You've gotta try to remember?
你要试着记住吗

71
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,584
Well, you know.
嗯，你懂得

72
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:12,192
I just want to do it right, and I don't have all this stuff in my head all the time.
我只是想做得对，而我一直没有把所有这些东西都放在脑海里

73
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:15,050
So it should be ILogger.
这里应该是 ILogger 吧

74
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:18,848
Is it, you probably need to add it as a service.
是的，但你可能需要添加相应的服务

75
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:20,650
Yes, add it as a service.
好的，添加服务

76
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,432
and then we have to use it.
我们必须使用它

77
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:24,864
Yeah, just AddLogging.
`AddLogging` 就好了

78
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:33,504
And then we've got app. I don't think it's used...
然后我们可以用 app ，我不认为它是这样用的

79
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:37,088
Do you put it up so, ILogger?
你把它搞定了吗，是 ILogger 吗

80
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:38,076
Yeah, I think it's ILoggerFactory.
我认为这应该是 ILoggerFactory

81
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,200
I think it's, yeah.
我想是的

82
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,832
-See? -Yes, you have to add the extension.
-看到了吗？ -是的，你必须添加扩展

83
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:46,496
Comes out of extensions, that's good.
这部分脱离出来变成了拓展，这很好

84
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:49,888
Geeks' work makes for the best work.
极客们的工作是它变得更好

85
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:51,040
Yeah, there you go, Okay.
那这样就好了

86
00:05:55,456 --> 00:06:04,160
Then we'll say hey, loggerFactory, And you can say, well if I'm running it at the console, I can add the console.
然后我们只需这样，嘿， loggerFactory ，如果我在控制台中记录日志，我可以添加控制台

87
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:07,040
Cuz you can log to all kinds of places, right, you can log to files
而且你可以记录到各种各样的地方，比如说文件

88
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,048
you can log it into Application Insights if you will, all kinds of things
或者 Application Insights ，如果你愿意的话，各种东西都行

89
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:17,088
And if you go and do Application Insights that's going to ask you all kinds of questions as well.
如果你使用 Application Insights ，那它会需要一些参数

90
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:20,608
Right now for now, I'm going to AddConsole, I'm going to AddDebug.
现在，我就使用了 `AddConsole` 和 `AddDebug`

91
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:26,432
Do you need the first one any more?
你还需要第一行代码吗？

92
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:34,304
The console one is if I'm running it from the command line and if I ever want to, I'd think I'd like to have that
这行代码是在我从命令行运行的时候想要输出日志，那我想我会需要它

93
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:36,480
-So it's a choice? -Well it's a
-那么这是一个选择吗 -嗯，是的

94
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,875
I'm gonna be doing stuff or someone on my team works on the console and I'd like to be able to spit at them
若我或者我团队中的某人在控制台中运行时，我希望向他们输出些信息

95
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,475
To the console when possible
在有可能的情况下，向控制台输出

96
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:44,775
So what I'm trying to point out is that you don't need both of them, right?
所以我想说的是你不需要同时有两个，对吗

97
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:50,496
No, one, I'm pointing the I'm pointing the logging to multiple locations.
不不，在这我指的是我正在将日志输出到多个位置

98
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,824
I could point it out to app insights, I could put it in text file, I could put it in database.
我可以把它输出到 app insights ，文本文件，或者是数据库

99
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,192
It'd be weird,but I could do that
这很奇怪，但我能做到这一点

100
00:06:56,192 --> 00:07:00,700
So right now I'm sending logging to two places, pardon me.
所以现在我把日志输出到了两个地方，原谅我

101
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:08,350
Yeah so yeah it's cool to do that and then, in a place that I might wanna use it
是的，这样做很酷，然后，在一个我可能想要使用它的地方

102
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:11,872
remember how we put everything on one line there before?
还记得我们之前如何把所有东西放在一行代码中嘛

103
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:19,616
We're gonna take it out and I think I would say, private ILogger.
我们要把它展开，我想我会用 private ILogger

104
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:40,425
And I think it would be of type CreateModel and I'll just say Log, and then we say ILogger<CreateModel> Log
我认为它将是 CreateModel 类型，我只需键入 Log ，然后我们需要 ILogger<CreateModel> log

105
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:42,208
and then again we squirrel it away
之后我们再次换行

106
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:48,550
Now here I am mixing things, here this person went underscore db, and I said capital L
现在这里我用了不同的风格，这里这个人使用的 _db ，我用的大写的 L

107
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,296
you should pick a style and stick with it
你应该选择一种风格并坚持下去

108
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:54,475
-So is the underscore really just a style? -It's just a style
-那么下划线真的只是一种风格吗？ -这只是一种风格

109
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:57,150
It's like saying this is private or it's read only, or it's internal.
就是说这是私有的，或者它是只读的，或是内部的

110
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,656
Lots of people have different styles.
很多人都有不同的风格

111
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,800
You tend to use capitals for publics.
公开属性最好以大写开头

112
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,784
There is a time when we used to say m_ for secret member.
曾经有一段时间我们使用 m_ 来标记私有成员

113
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:11,712
Now sometimes people put _ for internal, or read only.
现在人们有时把 _ 用于内部或只读变量

114
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:15,808
I'm just, I should be more responsible in the way I name my things.
我只想说我应该对我命名的方式更负责任

115
00:08:15,808 --> 00:08:16,832
-Yes you should -I should
-是的，你应该的 -我会的

116
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,720
This string right here
这个字符串就在这里

117
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:32,384
I could maybe reuse And then, make it for log, okay?
我可以重用它，然后把它换成日志，对吗

118
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:34,624
-And I could say log -Level.
-我可以用 log -不同的日志等级

119
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:37,750
Yeah, I could say LogInformation, LogDebug, LogCritical.
是的，我可以用 LogInformation ， LogDebug ， LogCritical

120
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:40,256
Let's say, that that's critical It's totally not critical.
让我们用 critical 级别吧，虽然这完全不重要

121
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:42,368
But I could say, that's a bad thing.
但我可以说，这里出现了一些问题

122
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:44,352
My goodness, customer added.
客户也会说，我的天哪

123
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:47,872
Right and then, it might come out red, right?
对，然后，它可能会变红，对吧

124
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:50,880
And actually that would be cool to try.
实际上这值得我们去尝试一下

125
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,625
So, if I am a web application.
所以，如果是一个 Web 应用

126
00:08:54,925 --> 00:09:01,025
-And where is my web application? -It is down here
-我的 Web 应用在哪里 -它在这儿

127
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:05,284
So let's go over to that location.
那么让我们去那个地方

128
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,164
And I'll try dotnet run in the command line.
我将尝试在命令行中执行 dotnet run

129
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,575
This is a good reminder that you can do these things in Visual Studio
这是一个很好的提醒，你可以在 Visual Studio 中做这些事情

130
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,864
or you can jump back out into the command line
或者你可以跳回命令行操作

131
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:19,872
-that's cool, too -So it's giving you 64005.
-这也很酷 -它给了你 64005端口

132
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:33,760
Oops, so I put that there, I put this here.
哦不，让我把它放在那里，把它放在这里

133
00:09:38,688 --> 00:09:46,304
-There it was, critical -All right, that's the console one
-它在那， critical -很好，这是控制台的形式

134
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,912
So the idea there is that that information could go lots of different places.
之前提到过的想法，就是信息可以向多个不同的地方输出

135
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:56,200
-So let's close that up -We can see it in the debug
-所以让我们关闭它 -我们可以在调试中看到它

136
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,216
And and let's go and do it in Application Insights.
然后让我们在 Application Insights 中进行操作

137
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,416
And you can see the debugger as well, right?
你也可以看到调试器，对吗

138
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,320
The point is that, that stream of information is going out into the world
关键是，这条信息流正在向外传播

139
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,816
it can go out into the command line, it can go out into a window
它可以进入命令行，一个窗口

140
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:13,632
it can go into Windows Debug text file, totally up to you.
或是 Windows Debug 文本文件，这完全取决于你

141
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,488
All right, so, I'm gonna declare tab bankruptcy.
好吧，所以，我要关掉一下标签页

142
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:29,056
-This is too much, stressed me out Okay, go back over here
-这太多了，已经影响到我了 -好的，回到这里

143
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:35,456
And I'm gonna right-click, and I'm gonna say, Add > Application Insights
我要点击右键使用，添加 > Application Insights

144
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:40,896
-And you've done this before many times -Here's the trick, though
-而且你已经做过好几次了 -不过这是诀窍

145
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,528
You can do this and sign up in Azure, you can use it for free, you get like what, a gigabyte?
你可以这样做，注册一个 Azure 账号，你会发现这是免费的，大概会有 1G 的流量

146
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:52,224
-Something like that -There, we'll go and register your app
-就是这样 -在那里，我们将注册你的应用

147
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:55,744
And even though you're running your app locally, send the telemetry up into the cloud.
即使你在本地运行应用，也可以将遥测数据发送到云端

148
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:57,664
We'll do this a bit a little bit later.
我们稍后会这样做

149
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,848
But I wanna point out to people that you don't have to do it that way, okay?
但我希望向大家指出的是这并不是必须的，是吧

150
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,640
They would like you to sign up.
他们希望你注册

151
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:06,560
And l think that you would get value if you sign up.
而且我认为你注册是值得的

152
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,424
-But, you can also try local only -It's a little subtle.
-但是，你只尝试在本地运行也没问题的 -这也不错

153
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:15,968
So you can try local only which means none of your data would be sent up into the cloud.
因此，你可以尝试只在本地运行，这意味着你的数据不会被发送到云端

154
00:11:16,224 --> 00:11:20,192
But it's a data that you can export and put somewhere else.
但你可以把这些数据导出来放到任意地方

155
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:21,408
Like, you can send a report to someone.
比如，你可以向某人发送报告

156
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:28,512
Sure, the point is that the cloud can give you a lot more insight, it's gonna apply all the analytics.
当然，重点是云可以为你提供更多洞察力，它可以提供所有的分析功能

157
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:31,008
And you have kinda an unlimited amount of space in the cloud.
而且你在云中拥有无限的空间

158
00:11:31,008 --> 00:11:32,864
I think it's a gig for free.
我记得这些都是免费的

159
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:37,216
And then, beyond that, you can do all kinds of things in the cloud you can't do locally
然后，除此之外，你还可以在云中执行各种不能在本地执行的操作

160
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:42,336
But the point I'm making is that there's no reason not to try it out locally.
但我要说的是，没有理由不在本地尝试

161
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:45,024
You can do amazing stuff with it even on an airplane.
这样即使在没有网络的飞机上，你也可以用它做出惊奇的东西

162
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:48,544
-You know what I mean? -So, lets go and run this
-你知道我的意思吧 -所以，让我们去运行它

163
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:52,576
-And you just added the app inside some -Yeah, that's a good point
-你刚刚在一些应用内部添加了些什么 -嗯，问得好

164
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,296
By running that, I just added that package, and it plugged itself into the pipeline, okay?
通过执行前面的步骤，我添加了一个包，且它会将它自己添加到 pipeline 中

165
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:03,840
So you didn't have to manually add it into your pipeline at all.
因此，你不必手动将其添加到 pipeline 中

166
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,168
-It's automatically added by default? -Yeah, it's magic.
-它会默认自动添加 -是的，这很神奇

167
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:13,504
I think we can actually look at the, Let's go out to where that was
我想实际上我们可以看看它，让我们转到那里

168
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:18,624
Where is that file located?
这个文件在什么地方呢

169
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:25,728
The csproj is here, and we can open it up
csproj 在这里，我们可以打开它

170
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,184
-There it is -There, okay
-它就是了 -好的，好的

171
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:30,784
So it's just a package.
所以它只是一个包

172
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:34,752
And once it gets in there, it's plugged into the pipeline.
一旦它添加之后，就会添加到 pipeline

173
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:36,672
And it's gonna collect all kinds of stuff.
它会收集各种东西

174
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:40,768
But now I can go, and really query my application.
现在我可以去真正地查询我的应用

175
00:12:40,768 --> 00:12:43,008
-So it's running right now -Should be clear
-它现在正在运行 -应该清理一下

176
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,775
Let's go and do our create stuff.
我们去创建一些内容

177
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,608

当然，你可以过滤，只是告诉我创建的信息，或是使用这个版本的人，或是使用 Chrome 的人
